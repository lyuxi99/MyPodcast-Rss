Hello and welcome to Planet Money's Summer School.

6
00:00:34,945 --> 00:00:39,088
The economics education you always dreamed of, but never quite got around to.

7
00:00:39,809 --> 00:00:43,452
This is class number one, Decisions and Dating.

8
00:00:46,210 --> 00:00:46,751
I know, I know.

9
00:00:47,011 --> 00:00:52,256
You thought you'd have the whole summer off riding bikes, going to the beach, staring at the clouds and doing nothing.

10
00:00:52,957 --> 00:00:58,282
Well, the good news is you can still do that while simultaneously exploring the world of economics.

11
00:00:58,702 --> 00:00:59,383
I'm Robert Smith.

12
00:00:59,623 --> 00:01:07,110
Every Wednesday to Labor Day, we are going to meet here in your ears to learn the essential principles of Econ 101.

13
00:01:08,251 --> 00:01:13,994
Each lesson will feature stories from some of our favorite Planet Money episodes, and yes, it is going to be on the test.

14
00:01:14,374 --> 00:01:20,177
At the end of the series, if you can pass our online final exam, you'll be eligible for a Planet Money diploma.

15
00:01:20,797 --> 00:01:21,698
Not a real diploma.

16
00:01:22,258 --> 00:01:23,038
Suitable for framing.

17
00:01:23,658 --> 00:01:26,720
Today on the show, how to think like an economist.

18
00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:31,491
This has been the greatest thing that I've picked up posting Planet Money over the years.

19
00:01:31,931 --> 00:01:38,414
Every problem, every decision you face can benefit from stepping back and looking at it like an economist would.

20
00:01:39,094 --> 00:01:44,336
In order to help us with this superpower, we've brought in two economists in residence this summer.

21
00:01:44,857 --> 00:01:47,478
I'm gonna allow them to give a short and lively introduction.

22
00:01:47,938 --> 00:01:48,718
I'm Justin Wolf.

23
00:01:49,519 --> 00:01:50,379
You go first, Betsy.

24
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:57,782
Justin was pointing at me to go first and then you said short and lively and so then he realized he needed to take over.

25
00:01:59,567 --> 00:01:59,972
I could do it.

26
00:02:00,353 --> 00:02:04,936
Professor Justin Wolfers and Professor Betsy Stevenson are collaborators.

27
00:02:04,976 --> 00:02:07,437
They wrote a textbook together, Principles of Economics.

28
00:02:07,897 --> 00:02:10,999
They've charmed introductory econ students at the University of Michigan.

29
00:02:11,179 --> 00:02:12,280
We're sort of a couple, too.

30
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:13,220
They are a couple.

31
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:17,402
They have two amazing children, hopefully busy and quiet in the next room.

32
00:02:17,983 --> 00:02:18,543
Hey, professors.

33
00:02:19,143 --> 00:02:19,243
Hi.

34
00:02:19,423 --> 00:02:19,964
Good to be here, mate.

35
00:02:20,224 --> 00:02:29,149
So when I took my very first course in economics, and we're talking high school here 30 years ago, the way it started was pretty grim.

36
00:02:29,889 --> 00:02:34,372
The teacher at the time would say, you know, economics is all about scarcity.

37
00:02:34,552 --> 00:02:39,955
There's not enough stuff in the world, and economists figure out who gets which stuff.

38
00:02:40,655 --> 00:02:43,677
And once we were properly scared, we moved into supply and demand.

39
00:02:44,337 --> 00:02:47,399
But when you teach economics, how do you start the class?

40
00:02:48,079 --> 00:02:50,620
Every year, my first sentence is economics is not about money.

41
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:54,643
And I tell them, I think it's a lens of great power and beauty.

42
00:02:55,283 --> 00:02:59,085
And it can help them understand everything from the stock market,

43
00:02:59,587 --> 00:03:04,629
to marriage and divorce, to crime, to elections, to the decisions you make in your everyday life.

44
00:03:05,169 --> 00:03:11,352
That explanation you heard 30 years ago, Robert, I think it's a very glass, half empty way of thinking about economics.

45
00:03:11,592 --> 00:03:18,015
It's an idea that there's not enough stuff in the world, and so how are we going to fight to the death to get our share?

46
00:03:18,872 --> 00:03:30,361
There's a glass half full vision that I like to start with, which is how can we allocate what we have in a way that makes as many people happy as possible?

47
00:03:30,882 --> 00:03:35,886
How can we make decisions in life that let us live our best possible life?

48
00:03:36,608 --> 00:03:42,554
The first economic principle we'll touch on in today's class is thinking about the world in terms of costs and benefits.

49
00:03:43,175 --> 00:03:46,519
For every choice you make, there is the joy you get from that choice.

50
00:03:46,919 --> 00:03:48,020
We call it the utility.

51
00:03:48,601 --> 00:03:52,505
And then there is the cost of the thing you didn't choose, the road not taken.

52
00:03:53,026 --> 00:03:58,491
Economists have fancy names for these things like opportunity cost and thinking at the margins, which we'll go over today.

53
00:03:59,172 --> 00:04:08,498
along with how to apply that economic advice to your everyday life, to your personal decisions, even who you date, because in economics, it is all about choices.

54
00:04:09,138 --> 00:04:15,001
Individual choices to economists are like atoms out of physicists.

55
00:04:15,362 --> 00:04:16,963
It's the base on which everything is built.

56
00:04:17,503 --> 00:04:18,523
That's what the economy is.

57
00:04:18,583 --> 00:04:20,965
It's a whole lot of individuals making choices.

58
00:04:21,431 --> 00:04:24,115
All right, today we're going to fire up the particle accelerator.

59
00:04:24,536 --> 00:04:31,707
We're going to aim it at individual choice, and we're going to see what makes up the very atomic structure of economics.

60
00:04:45,306 --> 00:04:47,127
So here's the way Planet Money Summer School's gonna work.

61
00:04:47,647 --> 00:04:57,912
In each class, we will play one of our favorite episodes, or excerpts from episodes, and we'll look for the big economic ideas in each one, and we'll talk it out with our in-house economists, Justin and Betsy.

62
00:04:58,453 --> 00:05:03,495
First up, a selection from our 2014 episode, Dear Economist, I Need a Date.

63
00:05:04,056 --> 00:05:06,477
It was hosted by Lisa Chow and Hannah Jaffe-Walt.

64
00:05:07,139 --> 00:05:14,006
When Lisa signed up for Match.com, she was at this point in her dating life where she'd been feeling like she needed a whole new approach.

65
00:05:14,386 --> 00:05:17,069
I had to be kind of more aggressive about it.

66
00:05:17,149 --> 00:05:20,352
I had to be more diligent and I had to be focused.

67
00:05:21,053 --> 00:05:22,294
Lisa was 31 years old.

68
00:05:22,374 --> 00:05:28,220
She'd just moved back to New York City and she'd basically spent her 20s in a series of long-term relationships.

69
00:05:28,799 --> 00:05:32,102
I kind of decided at 31 that I didn't have that luxury anymore.

70
00:05:32,142 --> 00:05:33,103
I couldn't do that anymore.

71
00:05:33,164 --> 00:05:35,246
And so I was much more efficient.

72
00:05:36,147 --> 00:05:40,171
I did make an Excel file and I started just writing down their names.

73
00:05:40,631 --> 00:05:46,597
Lisa needed the spreadsheet because in a year and a half, Lisa Chao went on 50 dates.

74
00:05:47,398 --> 00:05:49,320
50 first dates.

75
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:51,202
22 of the 50 I went on second dates with.

76
00:05:51,342 --> 00:05:51,742
Was it fun?

77
00:05:52,503 --> 00:05:53,604
Oh, it was so much fun.

78
00:05:53,904 --> 00:05:54,145
Really?

79
00:05:54,165 --> 00:05:55,486
Yeah, I really loved it.

80
00:05:55,546 --> 00:05:56,827
I mean, you know, it's so funny.

81
00:05:56,847 --> 00:05:59,769
I was actually really pleasantly surprised.

82
00:05:59,789 --> 00:06:02,051
I mean, there were some really nice guys.

83
00:06:02,431 --> 00:06:06,154
That is literally the first time I've ever heard that from a woman who dates online.

84
00:06:07,684 --> 00:06:08,525
Wow, really?

85
00:06:08,645 --> 00:06:13,328
Yeah, yeah, like pleasantly surprised how many really great guys there are.

86
00:06:13,628 --> 00:06:17,551
My colleague Lisa is a secret dating genius.

87
00:06:17,891 --> 00:06:19,092
I had no idea.

88
00:06:19,432 --> 00:06:25,276
She went on 51st dates and she never once felt sad or stressed or demoralized.

89
00:06:25,656 --> 00:06:27,998
She thoroughly enjoyed the entire experience.

90
00:06:28,638 --> 00:06:29,258
Here's what she did.

91
00:06:29,318 --> 00:06:39,680
She went on 50 dates and each time she went home after the date and she would record month, year, time, location, name, and one memorable detail.

92
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:43,741
Pothead, touchy, boring.

93
00:06:43,761 --> 00:06:49,702
Oh, this guy had four gym memberships.

94
00:06:50,362 --> 00:06:51,922
Oh, it was the one that I just saw that I loved.

95
00:06:52,162 --> 00:06:56,063
Here, for this person, you have Bob's head a bit too much.

96
00:06:57,410 --> 00:07:00,602
This guy, way west coast, but super cute dude.

97
00:07:03,113 --> 00:07:12,219
At the time, Lisa had lots of friends who were also dating online and they would all complain all the time about, you know, I wrote five guys and only one of them wrote me back.

98
00:07:12,659 --> 00:07:15,521
When I was doing online dating, I never wrote people emails.

99
00:07:15,561 --> 00:07:22,566
I mean, some people might call that a cop out, but I just said I'm gonna lower my transaction costs and purely just wink.

100
00:07:22,806 --> 00:07:24,768
And if they're really interested, they'll write back.

101
00:07:25,168 --> 00:07:32,453
I remember actually, I'd be sitting like watching some HBO show and just like sitting back on my computer and going click.

102
00:07:32,953 --> 00:07:37,495
click, click, you know, wink, wink, wink, you know, and not even thinking twice about it.

103
00:07:37,775 --> 00:07:40,577
The date needed to happen very soon after first contact.

104
00:07:40,757 --> 00:07:46,280
Lisa didn't want to build up some idea of the guy before meeting him and then have an opportunity to be disappointed.

105
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,661
Similarly, no dates on Friday or Saturday nights.

106
00:07:50,082 --> 00:07:54,504
She told me it's depressing to come home after a bad date on a weekend, so she just never let that happen.

107
00:07:55,452 --> 00:08:02,399
And if Lisa went on a third date with someone, she would always take them to a social gathering that included some casual friends of hers.

108
00:08:02,779 --> 00:08:04,841
That way she could observe them in a social setting.

109
00:08:06,002 --> 00:08:11,627
In other words, Lisa took something that's normally mysterious and squishy, human attraction.

110
00:08:12,508 --> 00:08:16,750
And she tried to strip it of all of the messy emotions.

111
00:08:17,170 --> 00:08:20,031
I really think that's what made her so successful.

112
00:08:20,151 --> 00:08:27,254
She made this thing that most people find so stressful and tedious that just sucks your time and self-confidence and hope.

113
00:08:27,934 --> 00:08:29,315
And she made that fun.

114
00:08:29,795 --> 00:08:36,620
And she did it using data and statistics and she applied the principles of economics to her love life and it worked.

115
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:39,942
There was one guy on number 45, right?

116
00:08:40,402 --> 00:08:46,686
And we were seeing each other for about six weeks and I just at one point just decided, okay, this is not going to work out.

117
00:08:47,667 --> 00:08:51,870
So I cut the cord and I thought like, did I make a mistake?

118
00:08:51,950 --> 00:08:54,631
Like, you know, we did have so many kind of things in common.

119
00:08:55,981 --> 00:09:01,584
And then the next week I went on a date with Kevin, and instantly I knew I didn't make a mistake, you know?

120
00:09:01,684 --> 00:09:07,687
And I was thinking, if I had stayed with that guy, you know, I wouldn't have had that opportunity to meet, like, the Kevin.

121
00:09:07,707 --> 00:09:13,390
It kind of crystallized right there, like, oh, okay, that's what an opportunity cost feels like, right?

122
00:09:13,430 --> 00:09:20,774
It's like when you stay with that guy, you're kind of feeling iffy about, and you're missing out on, you know, Kevin.

123
00:09:22,197 --> 00:09:25,486
Kevin, as you may have guessed, is Lisa Chow's husband.

124
00:09:25,526 --> 00:09:26,509
They got married.

125
00:09:26,589 --> 00:09:28,434
So economics to the rescue.

126
00:09:32,055 --> 00:09:35,377
And Lisa grabbed this really big concept.

127
00:09:35,397 --> 00:09:43,800
This is the first one we want to start with, this opportunity cost that anytime you decide to do something, there is something else you are not doing.

128
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:45,121
There are many things you're not doing.

129
00:09:45,321 --> 00:09:46,762
Wait, what's the more formal definition?

130
00:09:47,562 --> 00:09:52,264
We think of it as the true cost of doing something is the next best alternative you've got to give up to get it.

131
00:09:52,785 --> 00:09:56,006
What would you do in place of this thing you're doing?

132
00:09:56,026 --> 00:09:57,787
That's what you're going to give up.

133
00:09:58,799 --> 00:10:00,841
It's not just about time, though, right?

134
00:10:00,901 --> 00:10:02,563
There's an opportunity cost to weeding a donut.

135
00:10:03,343 --> 00:10:08,989
If I'm trying to limit my calories, 100 calories on a donut means I don't have 100 calories left for a beer later that night.

136
00:10:09,289 --> 00:10:11,351
The opportunity cost of the donut is the beer.

137
00:10:11,812 --> 00:10:18,718
And I think what's so beautiful about that episode is she really sort of fundamentally understood

138
00:10:19,704 --> 00:10:35,530
that even though she didn't know she was going to meet Kevin, but she understood that the opportunity cost of continuing in a relationship that didn't quite feel right was that she would give up the opportunity to meet someone who might be better.

139
00:10:36,370 --> 00:10:38,231
And what you have to do is take a gamble.

140
00:10:38,671 --> 00:10:40,292
Not a gamble, a calculated risk.

141
00:10:41,807 --> 00:10:52,152
But isn't this paralyzing to go through life as an economist and constantly think with every choice, well, I could do this, and I could do this, and I could do this, and what is this worth, and what is that worth, and what is that worth?

142
00:10:52,432 --> 00:10:54,193
No, it's incredibly free.

143
00:10:54,233 --> 00:10:54,833
Really?

144
00:10:55,153 --> 00:11:00,116
People won't waste your time if you know you're keeping track of and you're thinking about what you could be doing otherwise.

145
00:11:00,316 --> 00:11:02,897
It's quite useful to know what you're giving up.

146
00:11:03,217 --> 00:11:08,660
Sometimes you'll say, huh, maybe I should get out of bed and go on that date.

147
00:11:09,711 --> 00:11:10,731
In fact, actually.

148
00:11:10,751 --> 00:11:12,372
There's a certain reason Betsy's saying this.

149
00:11:12,812 --> 00:11:16,212
I was going to say, that's in fact how I met Justin.

150
00:11:16,572 --> 00:11:18,653
It was a Halloween about 400 years ago.

151
00:11:18,673 --> 00:11:21,213
And Betsy was at her home.

152
00:11:21,513 --> 00:11:22,854
Passing out candy to children.

153
00:11:22,994 --> 00:11:23,974
But do you remember who called you?

154
00:11:25,234 --> 00:11:25,714
My mother.

155
00:11:25,734 --> 00:11:26,374
Yeah.

156
00:11:26,614 --> 00:11:27,335
And what did she say?

157
00:11:27,855 --> 00:11:32,856
She said, you're not going to meet anybody staying at home, passing out candy to children.

158
00:11:32,876 --> 00:11:38,977
So she got dressed up, went to a party, stole one of my beers.

159
00:11:40,017 --> 00:11:41,338
And we've been inseparable since.

160
00:11:41,959 --> 00:11:53,166
So she said staying home means you're giving up the opportunity to go somewhere where you might meet some exciting people or you might have more fun.

161
00:11:54,367 --> 00:11:55,228
Some exciting people.

162
00:11:55,248 --> 00:11:56,089
That's how she describes me.

163
00:11:56,989 --> 00:11:57,850
Some exciting people.

164
00:11:58,659 --> 00:12:06,344
Not Mr. Wright, not the love of my life, but, you know, good and hard, where the marginal benefit of search no longer exceeds the marginal cost.

165
00:12:06,364 --> 00:12:08,165
A quarter century later, Justin.

166
00:12:08,185 --> 00:12:09,806
She still hasn't found a better option.

167
00:12:09,826 --> 00:12:13,589
See what I mean?

168
00:12:13,629 --> 00:12:14,970
It's romantic and empowering.

169
00:12:15,410 --> 00:12:22,615
Now, as we're talking about opportunity cost, and we're feeling overwhelmed, all these other costs we have to think of whenever we make decisions,

170
00:12:23,235 --> 00:12:27,939
There is, we should mention, one cost you should not be thinking about.

171
00:12:28,159 --> 00:12:31,241
And this has the fun name of sunk cost.

172
00:12:31,522 --> 00:12:34,304
How does sunk cost fit into this whole opportunity cost?

173
00:12:34,384 --> 00:12:38,787
Sunk costs are costs that cannot be reversed.

174
00:12:39,168 --> 00:12:41,910
You cannot undo them, even if you quit your project.

175
00:12:41,990 --> 00:12:42,891
You can't get your money back.

176
00:12:42,931 --> 00:12:44,332
You just can't get your money back.

177
00:12:44,472 --> 00:12:45,753
I'll give you a great example.

178
00:12:46,393 --> 00:12:47,834
You walk into a movie.

179
00:12:48,795 --> 00:12:53,338
And you've paid for the ticket and you're sitting there and the acting is horrible.

180
00:12:54,019 --> 00:13:01,384
The plot line is weak and you're bored out of your mind and you think I'd be better off going for a run right now.

181
00:13:01,644 --> 00:13:05,687
Yeah, but you think to yourself like I paid $16 for this movie ticket.

182
00:13:06,027 --> 00:13:08,529
I should stay until the credits roll.

183
00:13:09,030 --> 00:13:10,931
An economist that's you're saying would say,

184
00:13:11,464 --> 00:13:12,684
Get out of there, you should not stay.

185
00:13:12,844 --> 00:13:14,205
Get up and walk out.

186
00:13:14,225 --> 00:13:17,325
It doesn't matter how much you paid for the movie, that's a sunk cost.

187
00:13:17,725 --> 00:13:19,426
It's sunk because you can't get the money back.

188
00:13:19,706 --> 00:13:23,527
You can't get it back, but what you can do is not waste the rest of your time.

189
00:13:23,727 --> 00:13:25,607
Let bygones be bygones, just move on.

190
00:13:26,847 --> 00:13:28,268
Sunk cost, that is freeing.

191
00:13:28,648 --> 00:13:33,049
If opportunity cost makes me anxiety-ridden, then sunk cost is a freeing concept.

192
00:13:33,229 --> 00:13:37,950
You know, we've all got that friend who's been in a relationship with Mr. Not Very Good.

193
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:43,555
for maybe two years, maybe three years, and she calls you or he calls you and says, you know, should I continue with this person?

194
00:13:44,472 --> 00:13:48,576
And time and again, our friend says, you know, I've invested so much in this relationship.

195
00:13:49,276 --> 00:13:50,798
What you've invested is a sunk cost.

196
00:13:50,998 --> 00:13:51,919
You can't get it back.

197
00:13:52,179 --> 00:13:52,919
You should ignore it.

198
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:58,404
The fact that you've spent a lot of time being miserable with someone is not a reason to continue to be with them.

199
00:13:58,424 --> 00:14:04,570
So let me make the connection for you between sunk costs and opportunity costs, because they're really the same idea.

200
00:14:05,190 --> 00:14:10,254
It's that the opportunity cost principle asks you to compare the consequences of your choice

201
00:14:10,895 --> 00:14:12,476
with the next best alternative.

202
00:14:13,037 --> 00:14:16,579
So when you're thinking about your relationship, should you stay in it?

203
00:14:17,099 --> 00:14:27,046
What you're going to be thinking about is, well, what will I get out of this relationship if I stay in it, say another month, versus what would I get if I left and was doing something different?

204
00:14:27,546 --> 00:14:33,631
None of those considerations consider whether you've invested three years or three weeks or three days.

205
00:14:34,411 --> 00:14:43,779
So the opportunity cost when you're thinking about that movie and saying should I walk out the only thing that matters is what's the best way to spend the next hour of my life.

206
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:53,388
Is it staying in this movie or is it doing something else the fact that you bought a movie ticket not relevant it's in the past it's all about the future.

207
00:14:57,183 --> 00:14:58,583
It's like this episode of Planet Money.

208
00:14:59,164 --> 00:15:03,425
You should not keep listening because you've already invested precious minutes of your life.

209
00:15:03,565 --> 00:15:04,625
That is a sunk cost.

210
00:15:05,065 --> 00:15:08,326
Instead, you should think about the next best alternative.

211
00:15:09,166 --> 00:15:12,027
You could click on over and listen to Joe Rogan.

212
00:15:12,627 --> 00:15:16,248
Compare that option to the amazing things coming up in this episode.

213
00:15:16,528 --> 00:15:23,970
You will learn to identify exactly when you should stop wolfing down chicken McNuggets using the magic of marginal thinking after the break.

214
00:15:29,141 --> 00:15:36,972
I want to tell this story from the big economics convention, AEA in 2017 was in Chicago.

215
00:15:37,132 --> 00:15:38,253
You were both there, yes?

216
00:15:38,734 --> 00:15:39,075
We were.

217
00:15:39,095 --> 00:15:39,215
Yes.

218
00:15:39,956 --> 00:15:40,557
It was freezing.

219
00:15:40,857 --> 00:15:41,939
It was zero degrees.

220
00:15:42,459 --> 00:15:43,681
The wind was brutal.

221
00:15:43,721 --> 00:15:45,924
We were all trapped in this hotel.

222
00:15:47,005 --> 00:15:50,267
And I was reporting and I was so hungry.

223
00:15:50,327 --> 00:15:54,609
And the only place that wasn't crowded to eat was in the basement and it was a McDonald's.

224
00:15:54,669 --> 00:15:58,570
And I'm like, fine, I'm going to have the smallest thing they offer.

225
00:15:58,590 --> 00:15:59,931
I'm going to save room for dinner.

226
00:15:59,951 --> 00:16:03,453
And I ordered a six piece chicken McNugget for $3.99.

227
00:16:03,733 --> 00:16:08,475
And the guy behind the counter says, well, you know, we have special.

228
00:16:09,415 --> 00:16:12,737
For the same price, you can get 10 instead of six.

229
00:16:14,059 --> 00:16:14,699
Is this a trick?

230
00:16:15,319 --> 00:16:19,081
Is Stephen Levitt over in the corner from the University of Chicago taking notes on my decision?

231
00:16:19,101 --> 00:16:21,062
I mean, because there is free disposal, you know.

232
00:16:21,522 --> 00:16:25,243
It's free to get the extra four chicken McNuggets.

233
00:16:25,263 --> 00:16:26,283
I was like, well, wait a minute here.

234
00:16:26,444 --> 00:16:31,105
On average, of course, the 10 McNuggets are cheaper, obviously, right?

235
00:16:31,425 --> 00:16:33,146
But that's not how I should make the decision.

236
00:16:33,286 --> 00:16:36,107
I only wanted six McNuggets.

237
00:16:36,127 --> 00:16:41,229
So what's the cost of number seven, number eight, number nine, number 10, the chicken McNuggets?

238
00:16:41,562 --> 00:16:48,064
Like it didn't cost me any more money, but honestly, I probably couldn't bring myself to throw the extra ones away.

239
00:16:48,144 --> 00:16:49,584
I would almost certainly eat them.

240
00:16:50,044 --> 00:16:54,985
I'd spoil my dinner, I'd gain weight, I'd increase my unhealthy intake by like 66%.

241
00:16:55,265 --> 00:16:59,486
So your fear was that you would eat them if you got them?

242
00:16:59,826 --> 00:17:00,166
Yeah.

243
00:17:00,586 --> 00:17:03,667
So I'm faced with this dilemma of the extra chicken McNuggets.

244
00:17:04,167 --> 00:17:11,409
And in economics, there is a name for this concept, this choice, this decision about whether I should have one more of something.

245
00:17:11,867 --> 00:17:14,290
So economists call this thinking on the margin.

246
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:15,351
On the margin.

247
00:17:15,851 --> 00:17:20,537
So we want to make decisions incrementally.

248
00:17:20,877 --> 00:17:30,968
It's easier to think incrementally to break a how many decision down into a series of smaller or marginal decisions like, should I have one more?

249
00:17:31,609 --> 00:17:36,611
So did I properly think on the margin there, the value of each additional chicken McNuggets?

250
00:17:36,631 --> 00:17:40,233
Yeah, because the price in terms of dollars was zero.

251
00:17:40,493 --> 00:17:41,854
Which we call the marginal cost.

252
00:17:41,894 --> 00:17:45,015
How much extra do those four extra McNuggets cost?

253
00:17:45,095 --> 00:17:54,059
But when we think about the marginal benefit to you, it was actually negative because you'd have to use self-control to either force yourself to throw them away.

254
00:17:54,079 --> 00:17:55,040
Just throw them away.

255
00:17:55,647 --> 00:18:06,794
Or you would fail to use the self-control, and you would spend calories that you would have rather spent having a delicious dinner more delicious than the seventh McNugget.

256
00:18:06,854 --> 00:18:08,915
All right, so I'm starting to think on the margin.

257
00:18:08,955 --> 00:18:16,119
I'm thinking the cost of one more thing, the benefit, the utility, the joy I get from one more thing.

258
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:17,560
I'm balancing these two.

259
00:18:18,281 --> 00:18:20,282
How do we add this all together for decisions?

260
00:18:20,884 --> 00:18:30,166
So the key idea of the marginal principle is it just provides a simple rule of thumb to help you think through getting the most you can out of life.

261
00:18:30,806 --> 00:18:42,689
And it really comes down to the idea that if something's worth doing, you should keep doing it until your marginal benefits from doing more of it are just equal to your marginal costs from doing more of it.

262
00:18:42,829 --> 00:18:45,110
And that tells you when it's time to stop.

263
00:18:45,893 --> 00:18:47,333
economists call this the rational rule.

264
00:18:47,914 --> 00:18:51,015
You might say, why would I do something until the marginal benefits equal?

265
00:18:51,775 --> 00:18:56,756
Well, the answer is you want to make any choice where the marginal benefit exceeds the marginal cost.

266
00:18:57,456 --> 00:19:05,459
If you take every opportunity where marginal benefit exceeds marginal cost, the very last opportunity that's left is the one where the marginal benefit equals marginal cost.

267
00:19:05,579 --> 00:19:12,361
So you know that from the cost benefit principle that if the benefits exceed the cost, it's a good choice.

268
00:19:13,401 --> 00:19:19,865
And so when you apply that marginal principle, you think incrementally on the margin.

269
00:19:19,885 --> 00:19:25,348
It allows you to really narrow in and say, what are the marginal benefits I'm going to get from this decision?

270
00:19:25,809 --> 00:19:27,650
What are the marginal costs I'm going to face?

271
00:19:27,670 --> 00:19:31,052
And am I going to be better off if I say yes?

272
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:38,483
We're gonna take a quick break, and then we're gonna put all of our concepts, opportunity costs, thinking at the margins, to work.

273
00:19:39,024 --> 00:19:45,187
By taking a very, very expensive car ride across Manhattan, do you want one more chunk of Planet Money?

274
00:19:46,047 --> 00:19:47,088
We'll be waiting for your decision.

275
00:19:50,010 --> 00:19:51,951
Planet Money TikTok, that's economics.

276
00:19:52,131 --> 00:19:55,052
Planet Money TikTok, how did you guys get verified?

277
00:19:55,253 --> 00:19:58,695
Planet Money TikTok, same great taste, half the calories.

278
00:19:59,015 --> 00:20:00,956
Planet Money TikTok, tell your kids to learn.

279
00:20:04,136 --> 00:20:05,217
That's definitely the one.

280
00:20:06,820 --> 00:20:13,849
Our last story today features economics playing out in real time before your very eyes on the streets of Manhattan.

281
00:20:14,510 --> 00:20:19,676
The story is from 2014 when we were obsessed with what was at the time a pretty new company.

282
00:20:20,497 --> 00:20:20,737
Uber.

283
00:20:21,317 --> 00:20:24,379
The Uber app features something that we don't often see in economics.

284
00:20:24,599 --> 00:20:27,400
Prices changing by the minute before your eyes.

285
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:28,661
Surge pricing.

286
00:20:29,121 --> 00:20:29,841
I'm sure you've seen this.

287
00:20:30,041 --> 00:20:33,823
When a lot of people are calling an Uber on the app, the price for the ride goes up.

288
00:20:34,143 --> 00:20:39,406
Two times the regular rate, 2.4 times the regular rate, three times six times the regular rate.

289
00:20:40,146 --> 00:20:42,007
Needless to say, this pisses people off.

290
00:20:42,087 --> 00:20:43,468
It feels unfair.

291
00:20:43,889 --> 00:20:51,214
It can feel like only people with money can get where they're going, and the poor have to wait in line to hail an old-fashioned cab or even walk.

292
00:20:51,814 --> 00:20:56,937
But from an economic perspective, something quite remarkable is happening during an Uber surge.

293
00:20:57,558 --> 00:20:59,919
This was the topic of our episode from 2014.

294
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:03,362
Zoe Chase and Lisa Chow hit the streets for a story.

295
00:21:04,968 --> 00:21:10,712
I met Ann Chernikov in a line of people waiting for taxis outside of Penn Station.

296
00:21:11,112 --> 00:21:16,175
It's 20 degrees outside, snowing, everyone wants a cab and there aren't many cabs.

297
00:21:16,395 --> 00:21:18,977
So the wait is long, about 30 minutes.

298
00:21:19,297 --> 00:21:26,481
An economist would say people like Ann, they may not be paying a higher the usual cab fare if they're waiting just in the taxi line.

299
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:28,261
but they're still paying.

300
00:21:28,421 --> 00:21:29,761
They're just paying with their time.

301
00:21:30,181 --> 00:21:39,305
Time spent waiting here on this line in the cold and Uber is giving them this other option that instead of paying with time, they could just pay with their money.

302
00:21:39,745 --> 00:21:40,385
Would you pay double?

303
00:21:40,785 --> 00:21:41,005
Yeah.

304
00:21:41,765 --> 00:21:42,466
Would you pay triple?

305
00:21:44,166 --> 00:21:44,386
Maybe.

306
00:21:47,333 --> 00:21:50,777
It depends if the cats keep coming this slowly, it gets more likely.

307
00:21:50,797 --> 00:21:51,377
Too maybe.

308
00:21:51,778 --> 00:22:03,791
So the argument for Uber is people like Ann would benefit, people willing to pay with money instead of their time, and other people would benefit too, specifically Uber drivers like Aura Hachetrian.

309
00:22:04,031 --> 00:22:07,795
He tells me the story of December 14th here in New York City.

310
00:22:08,123 --> 00:22:12,864
It was rain, snow, sleet, freezing weather.

311
00:22:13,024 --> 00:22:14,364
So we were not driving.

312
00:22:14,384 --> 00:22:16,124
We were more like sliding on the streets.

313
00:22:16,625 --> 00:22:19,905
On top of that, it was also the day of Santa con.

314
00:22:20,305 --> 00:22:24,426
That's where people dress up as Santa Clauses and go get wasted.

315
00:22:25,166 --> 00:22:28,107
I remember that day of Santa con.

316
00:22:28,207 --> 00:22:29,207
It was bad.

317
00:22:29,347 --> 00:22:34,548
I was actually in Penn Station and I was surrounded by drunk Santas singing Christmas carols.

318
00:22:34,868 --> 00:22:36,208
And I took the subway.

319
00:22:36,557 --> 00:22:39,259
It was almost impossible to get a cab that day.

320
00:22:39,659 --> 00:22:43,641
Uber prices surged to seven, eight, nine times their usual rates.

321
00:22:44,101 --> 00:22:48,464
Ara told me about this one couple he picked up that day at seven times the usual rate.

322
00:22:48,822 --> 00:22:52,843
When I picked them up, I felt very bad that I'm picking them up at that rate.

323
00:22:53,483 --> 00:22:54,323
And I apologized.

324
00:22:54,343 --> 00:23:00,285
I even offered to do some extra stuff for them, like, you know, get them a cup of coffee or something just to make them feel better.

325
00:23:00,305 --> 00:23:02,145
Can you describe the couple to me?

326
00:23:02,826 --> 00:23:03,106
Sure.

327
00:23:03,146 --> 00:23:05,286
There was a young couple about 25 years old.

328
00:23:05,746 --> 00:23:10,428
The girl was wearing a very short skirt in that, you know, chilly weather.

329
00:23:11,248 --> 00:23:15,449
And the guy told me that actually he doesn't mind paying the search price.

330
00:23:16,109 --> 00:23:20,473
because they were waiting for a cab for about an hour and a half outside.

331
00:23:20,693 --> 00:23:29,482
They called some car services, nobody had cars available, and his girlfriend was so frozen that she said, if he doesn't get her a cab, she's just dumping him.

332
00:23:30,002 --> 00:23:35,468
I guess, yeah, in that case, saving the relationship, it's worth paying seven times the regular price.

333
00:23:35,890 --> 00:23:38,311
Ara told me the final bill for this couple was $145.

334
00:23:38,351 --> 00:23:45,653
The couple decided their time was worth $145, and the guy that benefited from that was Ara.

335
00:23:46,013 --> 00:23:50,715
Without a service like Uber, that $145 would have gone uncollected.

336
00:23:51,155 --> 00:23:54,356
Nobody would have made that money where there was money to be made.

337
00:23:54,416 --> 00:23:59,398
And that idea that there's money left on the table, that drives economists crazy.

338
00:24:04,939 --> 00:24:08,601
That was Lisa Chow and Zoe Chase from a Planet Money episode in 2014.

339
00:24:09,602 --> 00:24:19,508
Now, listening along to this episode, our professors, Justin and Betsy, let's take the economic thinking that we've just learned and apply it to this situation, this Uber situation we just heard about.

340
00:24:20,068 --> 00:24:28,053
So I think the most interesting thing about a snowstorm in taxis is think about what happens on each side of the market.

341
00:24:28,633 --> 00:24:33,837
So the snowstorm means lots of customers, not many cabs, lots of demand, not much supply.

342
00:24:34,541 --> 00:24:35,181
How do we fix that?

343
00:24:35,642 --> 00:24:40,064
If we want more cars on the road, each of these drivers is thinking, should I work one more hour?

344
00:24:40,744 --> 00:24:43,485
They're thinking about the marginal benefit relative to the marginal cost.

345
00:24:44,126 --> 00:24:48,128
The marginal cost of being on the road in a snowstorm is, it's miserable, it's super high.

346
00:24:48,949 --> 00:24:51,730
The marginal benefit of being on the road is how much extra money I'm going to make.

347
00:24:52,330 --> 00:24:54,730
That is the price that they can charge for their rides.

348
00:24:55,390 --> 00:25:00,171
So the way to get them to want to more drivers to want to be on the road is for the price to rise.

349
00:25:00,451 --> 00:25:01,272
Search pricing.

350
00:25:01,312 --> 00:25:01,512
Yeah.

351
00:25:01,872 --> 00:25:04,892
Search pricing actually tries to bring out more drivers.

352
00:25:04,912 --> 00:25:06,973
This is a thing of price is an incentive.

353
00:25:07,533 --> 00:25:13,854
If we want more drivers on the road, a high price is an incentive for them to stay out on the road or to get up off the couch and get onto the road.

354
00:25:14,594 --> 00:25:17,535
Well, this shows you how the company itself Uber

355
00:25:18,246 --> 00:25:20,066
is thinking on the margin.

356
00:25:21,207 --> 00:25:29,068
In a normal kind of car service situation, I suppose you could order your drivers to go out in the snowstorm and just say, you have to do this or you're fired.

357
00:25:29,788 --> 00:25:44,651
But the genius of Uber and markets like it is that it's thinking about what will it take to influence the marginal decision of the person waiting for a cab, of the driver who's thinking about going out.

358
00:25:44,831 --> 00:25:47,152
It's really trying to affect their really next decision.

359
00:25:47,877 --> 00:25:52,843
The amazing thing about markets is it all works through voluntary exchange.

360
00:25:53,564 --> 00:25:54,986
And so it's exactly that.

361
00:25:55,006 --> 00:26:00,913
It's using incentives to try to encourage sellers to sell.

362
00:26:00,934 --> 00:26:01,474
Right.

363
00:26:01,634 --> 00:26:03,797
So the snowstorm problem is lots of buyers.

364
00:26:04,792 --> 00:26:06,852
Very few sellers, we need to solve that.

365
00:26:07,313 --> 00:26:12,274
A higher price is attractive to sellers, so it's going to get more cars on the road.

366
00:26:12,834 --> 00:26:14,334
And it's unattractive to buyers.

367
00:26:14,394 --> 00:26:15,935
Fewer people are going to want to take taxis.

368
00:26:16,375 --> 00:26:22,756
That higher price brings the quantity demanded down, the quantity supplied up, and brings the market closer to balance.

369
00:26:23,236 --> 00:26:24,116
I know people hate this.

370
00:26:24,357 --> 00:26:25,657
I hate this when I have to pay more.

371
00:26:25,857 --> 00:26:30,518
But once you learn economics, there is a certain joy in watching Uber during the search.

372
00:26:31,110 --> 00:26:39,077
You may not want to pay more, but you can see supply and demand happening in front of your eyes in real time on the app.

373
00:26:39,617 --> 00:26:44,121
And this balancing of supply and demand, I mean, this is happening in every market.

374
00:26:44,181 --> 00:26:46,043
This is happening inside every business, right?

375
00:26:46,263 --> 00:26:47,884
It's everywhere all around us.

376
00:26:48,085 --> 00:26:48,845
We just don't see it.

377
00:26:49,686 --> 00:26:52,869
It's even happening in the dating market.

378
00:26:53,189 --> 00:26:53,589
Okay.

379
00:26:53,970 --> 00:26:54,490
Oh, come on.

380
00:26:54,530 --> 00:26:58,774
Have you ever been in the nightclub where you notice that one gender is more numerous than the other?

381
00:26:59,905 --> 00:27:00,405
Okay.

382
00:27:00,766 --> 00:27:01,686
We're going back to dating.

383
00:27:01,866 --> 00:27:02,287
Go with it.

384
00:27:02,407 --> 00:27:02,887
Go with it.

385
00:27:02,987 --> 00:27:04,528
No, I just, I remember this night very well.

386
00:27:04,568 --> 00:27:10,672
Betsy took me out dancing in Philadelphia and we looked around and there was a lot more shielders than blokes in the bar.

387
00:27:10,692 --> 00:27:12,353
And this is a predominantly straight bar.

388
00:27:13,213 --> 00:27:16,656
And we noticed this, I mean, we'd call it a disequilibrium.

389
00:27:16,816 --> 00:27:18,877
The two sides of the market were not in balance.

390
00:27:19,337 --> 00:27:20,358
Not everyone was there to dance.

391
00:27:21,318 --> 00:27:23,240
And we saw market forces work.

392
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:28,463
Word got out that there was a, let's call it profit opportunity.

393
00:27:30,235 --> 00:27:37,199
For young men willing to dance at this particular bar and over the next two hours we watched equilibrium happen.

394
00:27:37,739 --> 00:27:40,940
So there was a surge of men coming into the building.

395
00:27:41,321 --> 00:27:53,226
There was quite literally a surge and I saw the supply and the demand of young men and women come into balance over a period of about two and a half hours.

396
00:27:53,246 --> 00:27:55,087
It was one of the most extraordinary things.

397
00:27:56,045 --> 00:28:01,587
This balance is called a market equilibrium, and that's gonna be our last Econi word of the day.

398
00:28:02,187 --> 00:28:15,992
And you can think of the market equilibrium as the point where the blokes meet the shillers, or in the Uber example, probably better, where the number of people who are willing to pay for the surge price are equal to the number of drivers willing to drive at the surge price.

399
00:28:16,592 --> 00:28:23,015
And so finally, and Betsy, I just wanna ask you, it doesn't necessarily mean that everyone gets what they want.

400
00:28:23,997 --> 00:28:26,919
in this situation when we have a market equilibrium, right?

401
00:28:27,099 --> 00:28:27,460
It doesn't.

402
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:32,363
And there's still people waiting in the snow because they can't afford Uber because the price is too high to them.

403
00:28:32,403 --> 00:28:34,265
There are drivers who are not out on the road.

404
00:28:34,445 --> 00:28:35,345
This is really important.

405
00:28:35,986 --> 00:28:38,007
Equilibrium tells us what's going to happen.

406
00:28:38,748 --> 00:28:42,270
It's our ethics that tell us what we think should happen or what we want to happen.

407
00:28:42,951 --> 00:28:44,152
They can be really different things.

408
00:28:44,232 --> 00:28:48,435
And so a market can be in equilibrium and there can still be a lot of pretty miserable outcomes.

409
00:28:49,390 --> 00:28:59,556
It is the case that there are often many market failures and market imperfections that mean that markets will come to rest at a place that's not socially desirable.

410
00:29:00,069 --> 00:29:05,451
our first class, and we're already getting into the messiness of taking intro economics out into the real world.

411
00:29:05,731 --> 00:29:09,132
Because all the choices we've talked about today have been in a vacuum.

412
00:29:09,592 --> 00:29:13,053
Remember, everyone else is also making their optimal choices.

413
00:29:13,593 --> 00:29:23,876
And in future classes, Planet Money Summer School will talk about how individual economic choices can have real impacts on your neighbors, your community, on inequality, and the future of the world.

414
00:29:25,382 --> 00:29:29,004
All right, classes come to an end, but we should probably go over our vocabulary words.

415
00:29:29,504 --> 00:29:33,607
We had opportunity cost, the value of the next best thing you're giving up.

416
00:29:34,127 --> 00:29:37,869
We learned to ignore sunk costs, and we spent a lot of time thinking at the margins.

417
00:29:38,309 --> 00:29:42,252
What is the cost of one more delicious chicken nugget?

418
00:29:43,032 --> 00:29:48,676
In every episode, we wanted to make sure that we leave you with an assignment that you can think about over the next week and share with us.

419
00:29:49,377 --> 00:29:51,418
Justin, we talked today a lot about dating.

420
00:29:52,059 --> 00:30:03,267
And so my assignment for our listeners is look at some other facet of your life that you may not have thought was fundamentally economic and look again and see if you can see market forces underpinning the decisions that people are making.

421
00:30:03,387 --> 00:30:12,914
Justin, Betsy, everyone in the class, we will gather next week when we will do supply and demand graphs on the radio using nothing but the power of the human voice.

422
00:30:13,575 --> 00:30:16,938
And we will find markets in the places you least expect them.

423
00:30:17,098 --> 00:30:18,519
Those are the most exciting places.

424
00:30:18,639 --> 00:30:20,560
We can't wait to get looking for them.

425
00:30:20,921 --> 00:30:22,262
Summer school class next Wednesday.

426
00:30:26,145 --> 00:30:28,267
Let us know what you came up with from our assignment this week.

427
00:30:28,447 --> 00:30:32,270
Take one of our economic concepts and find a strange place where you can see it in your own life.

428
00:30:32,670 --> 00:30:35,152
Does opportunity cost factor in your job?

429
00:30:35,653 --> 00:30:38,075
Can you think at the margin while you're making dinner?

430
00:30:38,615 --> 00:30:44,900
Our email is planetmoney at npr.org, or you can find us on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and TikTok.

431
00:30:45,261 --> 00:30:49,464
We're watching the hashtag PMSummerSchool for your questions all summer long.

432
00:30:50,005 --> 00:30:51,666
Or you can tag us, we're at PlanetMoney.

433
00:30:52,305 --> 00:31:00,588
Today's class was produced by Lauren Hodges with help from Darian Woods, Alexi Horowitz-Gazi, Nick Fountain, Liza Yeager, and sound design from Isaac Rodriguez.

434
00:31:00,988 --> 00:31:02,388
It was edited by Alex Goldmark.

435
00:31:03,068 --> 00:31:07,930
Betsy Stevenson and Justin Wolffers are professors of economics and public policy at the University of Michigan.

436
00:31:08,410 --> 00:31:13,692
And later this summer, they will debut their own new audio course, Think Like an Economist.

437
00:31:14,032 --> 00:31:15,492
You can find it on the Himalaya app.

438
00:31:16,793 --> 00:31:18,173
We'll be back next week with a class

439
00:31:18,742 --> 00:31:22,926
where pickles and potatoes end up in the wrong place and markets come to the rescue.

440
00:31:23,546 --> 00:31:24,107
I'm Robert Smith.

441
00:31:24,247 --> 00:31:25,048
This is NPR.

442
00:31:25,528 --> 00:31:26,129
Thanks for listening.
