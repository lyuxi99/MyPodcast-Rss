This is NPR.

00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:17,528
Hello and welcome to Planet Money Summer School, your eight week fast track to riches and power, or at least an understanding of how those things work.

3
00:00:18,089 --> 00:00:21,733
This is class number three, profit and cocaine.

4
00:00:22,771 --> 00:00:23,371
I'm Robert Smith.

5
00:00:23,511 --> 00:00:31,053
Every Wednesday till Labor Day, we are tagging along with you to the beach, to the park to teach you the essential principles of Econ 101.

6
00:00:32,054 --> 00:00:34,194
Oh, and did we mention there is going to be a test?

7
00:00:34,574 --> 00:00:43,697
Pass a few simple questions at the end of the course and we'll put your name on a planet money diploma suitable for framing, not suitable to be used as an educational credential.

8
00:00:44,397 --> 00:00:50,203
In class one, we talked about how economists think about individual decisions, costs and benefits, opportunity cost.

9
00:00:50,783 --> 00:00:55,928
Class two sorted out those decisions into a market, complete with prices and supply and demand.

10
00:00:56,649 --> 00:01:00,913
And now here in class three, we're going to get down to the business of business.

11
00:01:02,461 --> 00:01:03,661
What makes a product sell?

12
00:01:03,981 --> 00:01:06,542
What are the risks and rewards of being an entrepreneur?

13
00:01:07,122 --> 00:01:08,883
And how do you keep competitors out?

14
00:01:09,863 --> 00:01:15,664
Economists often like to look at the extreme cases of something in order to see the principles at work underneath.

15
00:01:15,684 --> 00:01:17,705
And that's what we're going to do in this class.

16
00:01:18,025 --> 00:01:25,366
The subject of today's lesson and story was one of the most notorious and successful crack dealers in Los Angeles in the 1980s and 1990s.

17
00:01:32,728 --> 00:01:39,310
But when I sold drugs, if they had told me they was going to legalize it, I would have been mad because I knew that that was going to dry the price down.

18
00:01:39,670 --> 00:01:43,771
We should note there's also a successful rapper and music executive named Rick Ross.

19
00:01:44,411 --> 00:01:49,293
He took that name as an homage to freeway Ricky Ross, but the two of them have no connection.

20
00:01:49,833 --> 00:01:56,755
Today on Summer School, we take a look at the economics of drug dealing and do a reality check with an actual drug kingpin.

21
00:01:57,415 --> 00:02:07,817
And then at the end of the episode, we'll bring in our economists and residents, Betsy Stevenson and Justin Wolfers, who will show us how the lessons learned on the street can be used to think about how all businesses work.

22
00:02:09,269 --> 00:02:12,030
This message comes from Western Governors University.

26
00:02:40,167 --> 00:02:45,812
A Minneapolis business owner's daughter is called out publicly for racist anti-black tweets.

27
00:02:46,633 --> 00:02:52,438
Fighting to save his business and trying to make amends, he calls on a prominent black Muslim leader for help.

28
00:02:53,198 --> 00:02:54,499
He's an Arab Muslim.

29
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:57,262
To hear what happens next, listen to Codeswitch from NPR.

30
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:12,822
This episode, Lessons from a Drug Kingpin, first aired in 2011, and I hosted it with Alex Bloomberg, who went on to be something of a kingpin himself in the world of podcasting.

31
00:03:13,402 --> 00:03:14,102
Okay, let's do it.

32
00:03:14,582 --> 00:03:23,845
We have in front of us a pile of academic papers talking about the economics of illegal drugs, and they all arrive at a surprising conclusion.

33
00:03:23,865 --> 00:03:31,828
The conclusion is this, when you make drugs illegal, you end up making drug dealers richer, and you increase the level of crime.

34
00:03:32,578 --> 00:03:42,009
and you don't end up reducing drug use by that much, which we should remind people is the whole point of making drugs illegal, to stop people from using drugs and to lower the amount of crime.

35
00:03:42,330 --> 00:03:46,915
So here we have these policies that are not doing what they're supposed to be doing, and let's lay out the theory of why that is.

36
00:03:47,075 --> 00:03:52,522
Okay, so the economics of this are, when you make something illegal, you make it harder and riskier to produce.

37
00:03:53,062 --> 00:03:55,183
In the case of drugs, you have to sneak them across the border.

38
00:03:55,503 --> 00:03:58,305
You have to pay people more to transport them since they're facing jail time.

39
00:03:58,325 --> 00:04:01,907
You have to hire armed guards to protect your supply.

40
00:04:02,047 --> 00:04:05,448
There's all of these added costs, which simply drives up the price.

41
00:04:05,628 --> 00:04:10,251
So illegal cocaine is many more times expensive than it would be if it were legal.

42
00:04:10,591 --> 00:04:12,612
And any economist can tell you what happens next.

43
00:04:12,912 --> 00:04:14,273
When the price of something goes up,

44
00:04:14,873 --> 00:04:16,173
Surprise, fewer people buy it.

45
00:04:16,433 --> 00:04:17,234
Take bananas.

46
00:04:17,514 --> 00:04:20,794
If they were 500 bucks a bunch, no one would buy bananas.

47
00:04:21,354 --> 00:04:22,255
But crack is different.

48
00:04:22,535 --> 00:04:27,196
The demand is what they call inelastic, no matter what it costs people are willing to pay for it.

49
00:04:27,236 --> 00:04:27,976
I mean, it's addictive.

50
00:04:28,336 --> 00:04:31,617
So increasing the price just means that more money goes to drug dealers.

51
00:04:32,077 --> 00:04:39,598
And to the criminal behavior they engage in, grabbing people, buying guns, threatening, hurting, or even killing people, that is the theory.

52
00:04:39,838 --> 00:04:41,599
But one thing missing from these economic papers

53
00:04:42,497 --> 00:04:43,218
actual drug dealers.

54
00:04:43,558 --> 00:04:45,479
And this brings us to freeway Ricky Ross.

55
00:04:45,799 --> 00:04:53,744
He started dealing cocaine in 1979, then he moved into crack, then he worked his way up to becoming one of the biggest crack dealers in LA.

56
00:04:54,105 --> 00:04:59,628
He was arrested in 1996 and given a life sentence, but in 2009 he was given parole and released.

57
00:05:00,209 --> 00:05:05,212
And we thought, here is a perfect person to run these economic theories by and see if they check out.

58
00:05:05,652 --> 00:05:05,992
Let's do it.

59
00:05:06,112 --> 00:05:09,214
Theory number one, making drugs illegal drives up the price.

60
00:05:09,615 --> 00:05:09,795
Check.

61
00:05:10,275 --> 00:05:13,278
The most I ever made in one day was $3 million, went through my hands.

62
00:05:13,598 --> 00:05:13,858
Wow.

63
00:05:14,539 --> 00:05:16,120
I could make off of a million bucks.

64
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:20,263
I could make anywhere from $400,000 to $200,000 profit.

65
00:05:20,724 --> 00:05:24,827
It varied to who I was selling to and what time of the money it was.

66
00:05:24,867 --> 00:05:27,169
You know, a lot of variables on how much I made.

67
00:05:27,229 --> 00:05:29,731
If I was giving it to him on credit, stuff like that.

68
00:05:30,472 --> 00:05:35,456
But I was sure to make $200,000 off of every million and sometimes I could make as much as $400,000.

69
00:05:35,736 --> 00:05:38,719
Let me just ask you, like how much

70
00:05:39,535 --> 00:06:00,006
of the cost of the drug that you were selling was because it was illegal i guess probably we maybe a thousand times uh... you can probably get a kilo of cocaine over in uh... columbia peru for maybe three hundred dollars or maybe even less than that you know if it wasn't illegal because maybe the former's probably would sell it for uh...

71
00:06:02,588 --> 00:06:05,930
would have passed away ahead of lettuce, because it grows over there, you know, wild.

72
00:06:06,731 --> 00:06:09,633
So, I mean, the price probably would drop dramatically.

73
00:06:10,014 --> 00:06:13,316
You probably could get a kilo for what it cost to buy a pack of cigarettes.

74
00:06:15,198 --> 00:06:15,778
Maybe cheaper.

75
00:06:16,038 --> 00:06:18,861
Keep in mind, Rick bought his kilos of cocaine for $10,000.

76
00:06:19,701 --> 00:06:27,608
All right, so next we ran another part of the theory by him, that at least some of the money he's getting is going to increased crime.

77
00:06:28,168 --> 00:06:29,089
Again, check.

78
00:06:29,609 --> 00:06:30,890
Well, I had a crew.

79
00:06:30,910 --> 00:06:33,272
I had a crew of anywhere from 30 to 40 guys.

80
00:06:33,492 --> 00:06:41,038
That varied too from what was going on, how good business was, how many rock houses I was running at the time.

81
00:06:41,499 --> 00:06:45,202
You always had an appearance of toughness, and I did.

82
00:06:45,682 --> 00:06:49,205
I had guys around me that were ruthless and were tough.

83
00:06:49,265 --> 00:06:51,306
If I gave the word, they would hurt you.

84
00:06:52,387 --> 00:06:54,869
How many guns did your operation have?

85
00:06:55,430 --> 00:06:56,070
Who knows?

86
00:06:57,392 --> 00:07:03,096
We bought guns regularly because guys would throw guns out the window when the cops get behind them and we lose guns all the time.

87
00:07:03,577 --> 00:07:11,023
And it was mandatory when we're on the street, like if we had to park playing basketball, we had to be strapped.

88
00:07:11,753 --> 00:07:16,034
Or if we had my tire shop where we sold drugs from, then we would have guns there.

89
00:07:16,394 --> 00:07:20,175
Now, it's really amazing the level of expenses that a big time drug dealer has.

90
00:07:20,215 --> 00:07:22,176
I mean, the drug money wouldn't just be for his crew.

91
00:07:22,556 --> 00:07:23,676
He would spread it around.

92
00:07:23,716 --> 00:07:27,637
I mean, his drug money would find its way into all sorts of other illicit activities in the neighborhood.

93
00:07:27,978 --> 00:07:31,318
For instance, he had money that he just distributed to the big players around the hood.

94
00:07:31,859 --> 00:07:36,340
You know, I had a fund also, you know, where I take care of what's called a big homies.

95
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:42,381
You know, these are the guys that, when I grew up, were the shot callers, the guys that ran the neighborhood.

96
00:07:42,921 --> 00:07:44,641
And, you know, I took care of them.

97
00:07:44,881 --> 00:07:48,762
In my neighborhood, anybody can get killed at any time.

98
00:07:49,482 --> 00:07:54,643
And for me to walk around the streets the way I did would be dangerous for a lot of people.

99
00:07:54,703 --> 00:07:55,883
Most people couldn't do what I did.

100
00:07:56,203 --> 00:08:04,505
You know, they couldn't walk around South Central Los Angeles in the middle of Hoover, Crip Gang, or the Swines.

101
00:08:05,505 --> 00:08:11,650
And live the way I live, you know, free and open, going to car washes, you know, they kidnap drug dealers in South Central.

102
00:08:12,251 --> 00:08:19,917
And I had a special type of pass that most people don't get, and that's because of my good ties that I shared in my wealth.

103
00:08:20,448 --> 00:08:23,831
So you basically, it was sort of like, you were paying protection money to these people, right?

104
00:08:23,991 --> 00:08:24,471
Absolutely.

105
00:08:24,491 --> 00:08:28,614
You can call it protection money, or big homie money, or whatever, but it's all the same thing.

106
00:08:29,035 --> 00:08:29,515
Absolutely.

107
00:08:29,815 --> 00:08:32,958
But it was money going to people who didn't sell drugs?

108
00:08:33,298 --> 00:08:33,998
Who would be violent?

109
00:08:34,018 --> 00:08:34,719
They were robbers.

110
00:08:35,119 --> 00:08:35,920
They were robbers.

111
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:36,881
They were killers.

112
00:08:37,281 --> 00:08:38,442
Jackers, as we call them.

113
00:08:38,962 --> 00:08:39,483
Absolutely.

114
00:08:39,783 --> 00:08:41,164
These guys didn't mind going to jail.

115
00:08:41,444 --> 00:08:42,965
So clearly the academics are right here.

116
00:08:43,205 --> 00:08:48,970
Drug money goes to crime, I guess that's not a big surprise, but not all of the money goes to crime and bribes and shady stuff.

117
00:08:49,270 --> 00:08:52,893
For example, freeway Rick Ross owned a lot of real estate.

118
00:08:53,193 --> 00:08:55,715
Crack houses, cook houses, places he stored his money.

119
00:08:56,076 --> 00:08:58,818
There were other expenses, like a huge expense.

120
00:08:59,338 --> 00:09:05,022
bail bondsmen, guys in his crew that he worked with would get picked up by the cops and he would need to make sure that they would stay loyal to him.

121
00:09:05,182 --> 00:09:07,443
So he would do whatever it took to get them out of jail.

122
00:09:07,483 --> 00:09:09,965
And of course, the criminal justice system knew that he was a big time drug dealer.

123
00:09:10,005 --> 00:09:12,726
So they set these bond prices really, really high.

124
00:09:12,746 --> 00:09:13,667
So that cost them a lot of money.

125
00:09:13,987 --> 00:09:14,187
Yeah.

126
00:09:14,267 --> 00:09:19,030
And another group of people who were profiting off of the big time drug dealer, lawyers.

127
00:09:19,351 --> 00:09:22,212
He had lots of lawyers and they charged him a lot of money.

128
00:09:22,693 --> 00:09:26,255
And they came into play when he would have these interesting disputes with the cops.

129
00:09:26,635 --> 00:09:39,922
What happened is they had raided a couple places and there were large amounts of money and no drugs and they would confiscate the money and then we would go to court and the lawyers would get the money back and that really frustrated them.

130
00:09:40,470 --> 00:09:42,711
Wait, so they would raid one of your houses.

131
00:09:43,051 --> 00:09:45,312
There would be a whole bunch of money there, but there wouldn't be any drugs.

132
00:09:45,992 --> 00:09:50,094
So you would actually go and say, I'm an honest businessman.

133
00:09:50,114 --> 00:09:50,894
That was my money.

134
00:09:51,474 --> 00:09:52,594
They have no right to take my money.

135
00:09:52,755 --> 00:09:53,295
Absolutely.

136
00:09:54,035 --> 00:09:59,317
I wouldn't go myself personally, but I had people in the system set up to where we could claim the money.

137
00:10:01,018 --> 00:10:02,898
They fed in a house in South Central.

138
00:10:02,918 --> 00:10:03,098
That's $400,000.

139
00:10:03,158 --> 00:10:05,539
Wouldn't you naturally think that's drug money?

140
00:10:08,050 --> 00:10:09,774
I mean, would you think that if it was Beverly Hills?

141
00:10:10,535 --> 00:10:11,016
True enough.

142
00:10:11,697 --> 00:10:13,621
And even if you think that, you have to prove it.

143
00:10:13,661 --> 00:10:15,225
You know, in court, it's not what you think.

144
00:10:15,946 --> 00:10:16,788
It's what you can prove.

145
00:10:17,148 --> 00:10:17,389
Right.

146
00:10:17,649 --> 00:10:19,694
And they couldn't prove that it was drug money, so you got it back.

147
00:10:20,138 --> 00:10:20,659
Absolutely.

148
00:10:21,179 --> 00:10:22,601
And they got frustrated with that.

149
00:10:22,701 --> 00:10:35,033
So what they started doing is they started, when they come into the house, they would bring their own drugs and then they would plant drugs and that makes it tougher for you to come to court and say, you know, your honor, I had $400,000 in here and it's missing.

150
00:10:36,375 --> 00:10:38,076
Because now it was two keys in there too.

151
00:10:38,917 --> 00:10:42,040
So now you got to tell the judge, your honor, the keys ain't mine, but the money is.

152
00:10:43,962 --> 00:10:46,284
I think that's, you know, a hard pitch.

153
00:10:46,525 --> 00:10:48,226
So we have these quasi-legal expenses.

154
00:10:48,446 --> 00:10:52,590
I mean, the money's going to people who probably pay taxes on it, lawyers and bail bondsmen.

155
00:10:53,011 --> 00:10:55,633
But then there are the expenses that are sort of in between.

156
00:10:55,753 --> 00:10:59,357
You know, they're under the table, but on the face, there's nothing illegal about these expenses.

157
00:10:59,777 --> 00:11:02,660
You know, take all the cash that Ricky's making.

158
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,782
Every business just deposits it in their account.

159
00:11:05,022 --> 00:11:06,283
Freeway Rick couldn't do that.

160
00:11:06,624 --> 00:11:07,484
Account 3,400,000 can be time-consuming.

161
00:11:09,366 --> 00:11:10,226
How did you count the money?

162
00:11:10,266 --> 00:11:11,607
Who did you get to count the money?

163
00:11:12,127 --> 00:11:17,929
Well, in the end, because money became a chore, so I hired a couple girls, and that was their job to count money all day.

164
00:11:18,309 --> 00:11:20,130
That's another cost of something being illegal.

165
00:11:20,150 --> 00:11:23,811
You have to hire people to count it, whereas if you just take it to a bank, you know... Absolutely.

166
00:11:23,831 --> 00:11:25,371
And then you got to worry about if they're stealing.

167
00:11:25,611 --> 00:11:25,832
Right.

168
00:11:26,512 --> 00:11:27,472
Because it's underground.

169
00:11:29,973 --> 00:11:36,135
So if you... Yeah, and you can't go and you can't file a claim against your underground drug money counters, if you think that's giving.

170
00:11:36,675 --> 00:11:44,420
So even though he's paying these women and they're not explicitly doing anything illegal, like just counting money isn't illegal, but there is also a social cost even here.

171
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:51,845
In other words, these women are probably young, they're coming in, they're seeing this big time drug dealer, they think this is the way to make money going into drugs.

172
00:11:51,885 --> 00:11:56,328
And that was of course also part of this, the social cost of what Rick was doing.

173
00:11:57,048 --> 00:12:10,939
Aside from the fact that crack is incredibly addictive, it decimated interstitial communities, creating the idea that this is the only way out, this is the only way to get rich, that's also a big part of the social cost of drug dealing.

174
00:12:11,219 --> 00:12:21,467
And we should say that as Rick is going through his internal dialogue about his own costs, he did not bring up a lot about the fact that this did devastate cities and he was partially responsible for it.

175
00:12:21,748 --> 00:12:21,888
Right.

176
00:12:22,468 --> 00:12:27,201
Although now he says on his website that he feels bad about that and he's trying to undo some of the damage that he caused.

177
00:12:27,957 --> 00:12:35,042
Now, there are a couple of the academic theories, the economist theories though, that did not check out when we ran them by Freeway Rick.

178
00:12:35,362 --> 00:12:47,130
For example, there's this one theory you see cited a lot in the literature that one of the factors that drives up the cost of drugs, you have to compensate people for the risk, the risk of going to jail, the risk of getting shot or killed.

179
00:12:47,530 --> 00:12:51,372
So, you know, it's just generally people who have dangerous jobs tend to make more money.

180
00:12:51,573 --> 00:12:53,654
Miners, people who work on fishing boats, you know,

181
00:12:53,994 --> 00:12:57,255
fishing boats out in Alaska, you need to pay them more since what they're doing is so risky.

182
00:12:57,675 --> 00:13:01,196
And the theory is that the same thing would apply to people in the drug trade.

183
00:13:01,636 --> 00:13:04,236
But that theory, at least in Rick's case, did not check out.

184
00:13:04,696 --> 00:13:11,778
Well, you know, first of all, when you come from where I was, when I started selling drugs, you know, you feel hopeless.

185
00:13:13,218 --> 00:13:20,059
You don't think you're going to live past 24 years old, going to jail, come out with stripes.

186
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:22,780
Really wasn't any risk.

187
00:13:23,965 --> 00:13:27,946
I mean, everything that I had going on at the time was nothing.

188
00:13:28,266 --> 00:13:30,627
You know, I was like a lump on the log.

189
00:13:30,667 --> 00:13:39,869
So the risk that most people would look at, I mean, you know, you could get killed, go to prison was okay.

190
00:13:41,510 --> 00:13:44,311
So you didn't really think, you weren't thinking like, I'm taking a lot of risk here.

191
00:13:44,331 --> 00:13:45,391
I have to get compensated.

192
00:13:46,483 --> 00:13:48,586
No, no, I didn't really add.

193
00:13:48,646 --> 00:13:52,071
I mean, the conversation was already enormous and overwhelming.

194
00:13:52,331 --> 00:13:54,154
I couldn't believe that it paid so well.

195
00:13:55,195 --> 00:13:56,757
You would have done it for a lot less is what you're saying.

196
00:13:57,158 --> 00:13:57,859
Oh, absolutely.

197
00:14:01,391 --> 00:14:05,953
Talking to Rick, we realized that there is something here that economists don't take into account.

198
00:14:06,614 --> 00:14:09,375
There was this emotional component to the work that Rick was doing.

199
00:14:09,615 --> 00:14:15,218
At least when you get to Rick's level, drug dealing is complicated, it's multifaceted, it's engaging.

200
00:14:15,578 --> 00:14:17,779
Yeah, like Rick was basically a CEO.

201
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:20,541
He was a manager, he was a publicist, he was his own accountant.

202
00:14:20,901 --> 00:14:22,222
He was even the head chemist.

203
00:14:22,882 --> 00:14:25,923
So I'll just back up for a second here and look at this situation.

204
00:14:26,443 --> 00:14:30,905
Society was doing everything it possibly could to make Ricky Ross's life miserable.

205
00:14:31,265 --> 00:14:32,446
His product was illegal.

206
00:14:32,606 --> 00:14:34,486
His costs were enormous as we've established.

207
00:14:34,867 --> 00:14:35,967
He was a hunted man.

208
00:14:36,087 --> 00:14:37,188
Literally a hunted man.

209
00:14:37,228 --> 00:14:41,489
He said there was a police task force in LA devoted entirely to putting him in prison.

210
00:14:41,749 --> 00:14:47,772
But despite all the money in the effort that the most powerful nation on earth was spending to make Rick Ross give up his job.

211
00:14:48,152 --> 00:14:48,672
I loved it.

212
00:14:49,552 --> 00:14:50,893
I felt like I was on top of the world.

213
00:14:50,913 --> 00:14:51,894
I felt I was powerful.

214
00:14:52,314 --> 00:14:53,175
I felt I had came.

215
00:14:53,195 --> 00:14:54,936
I didn't have to answer to nobody.

216
00:14:57,297 --> 00:14:58,178
I mean, it was a dream.

217
00:14:58,238 --> 00:15:00,820
It was every man's dream to be free.

218
00:15:02,481 --> 00:15:03,061
Did you miss it?

219
00:15:04,623 --> 00:15:05,343
Oh, absolutely.

220
00:15:06,184 --> 00:15:06,744
Absolutely.

221
00:15:08,705 --> 00:15:11,387
I'd rather be doing that than anything else almost.

222
00:15:11,828 --> 00:15:15,070
Everything else became almost like secondary to my work.

223
00:15:17,322 --> 00:15:17,782
You know, it's funny.

224
00:15:17,802 --> 00:15:20,624
You were talking about how, how great it was for a while.

225
00:15:20,664 --> 00:15:23,506
And one of the words you used was, was the freedom of it.

226
00:15:23,947 --> 00:15:28,870
And yet when you describe this in detail, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not hearing a lot of freedom.

227
00:15:28,910 --> 00:15:33,334
You had this task force and people are at the kill you and spotters and you're sneaking around the middle of the night.

228
00:15:33,514 --> 00:15:35,135
You have to be up at two 30 every morning.

229
00:15:35,215 --> 00:15:36,956
You're moving houses back and forth.

230
00:15:36,996 --> 00:15:40,659
This didn't sound, this sounds like a man who has very little freedom in his life.

231
00:15:41,239 --> 00:15:41,760
Well, you know what?

232
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:44,662
When you look at it from, from, from that angle, it is.

233
00:15:45,338 --> 00:15:51,043
But when you look at it from where I came from, then I felt like I had all the freedom in the world.

234
00:15:51,744 --> 00:15:58,650
How much of it was just sort of like the actual job and how much of it was just the feeling of being good at something and running this enterprise well?

235
00:15:58,990 --> 00:16:01,372
Well, you love the feeling that you're good.

236
00:16:01,733 --> 00:16:06,397
So it didn't feel like it was a burden to sneak around at night.

237
00:16:06,957 --> 00:16:13,619
I've been sneaking around at night since I was, you know, 17 years old, still in cars, you know.

238
00:16:14,319 --> 00:16:22,941
So this it became, it's like when you saying that it's not freedom, but from where I come from, this is the way of life.

239
00:16:23,501 --> 00:16:24,461
This is the way we live.

240
00:16:24,521 --> 00:16:26,782
It's nothing wrong with living like that, sneaking around at night.

241
00:16:29,242 --> 00:16:30,743
You know, we've been hiding all our life.

242
00:16:31,203 --> 00:16:35,244
So, Robert, one question remains at the end of our journey here with the freeway rick.

243
00:16:35,484 --> 00:16:36,244
What does this all mean?

244
00:16:36,264 --> 00:16:39,725
I mean, are we saying we should be legalizing crack?

245
00:16:40,385 --> 00:16:46,406
I mean, if we really did want to make the freeway ricks of the world go away, we would take away the earning potential, I guess, right?

246
00:16:46,426 --> 00:16:48,606
Yeah, by legalizing drugs and dropping the price.

247
00:16:49,027 --> 00:16:50,627
And some of the economists we spoke to said,

248
00:16:51,247 --> 00:16:52,008
Yeah, of course.

249
00:16:52,288 --> 00:16:54,110
Making it illegal makes dealers richer.

250
00:16:54,270 --> 00:16:58,053
It creates more violence and crime and doesn't do that much to drive down demand.

251
00:16:58,333 --> 00:16:59,715
So clearly legalize it.

252
00:17:00,215 --> 00:17:02,157
Other economists, though, they weren't so sure.

253
00:17:02,337 --> 00:17:05,640
Peter Reuter has written a book about the illegal drug market.

254
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:07,481
He's written many, many papers.

255
00:17:07,802 --> 00:17:09,904
He is a big expert in this field.

256
00:17:10,204 --> 00:17:10,584
And he says,

257
00:17:11,665 --> 00:17:14,928
Legalizing something like crack, there would definitely be trade-offs.

258
00:17:15,468 --> 00:17:17,590
Legalization would dramatically reduce crime.

259
00:17:18,631 --> 00:17:35,505
Obviously, the drug market crime would disappear and many drug-related crimes where it's sort of in the business economic compulsive crimes, that is crimes committed in order to pay for expensive illegal drugs, that would go down a lot too.

260
00:17:36,887 --> 00:17:38,108
What goes on the other side?

261
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:40,782
I'm making up the number here.

262
00:17:40,802 --> 00:17:42,363
5 million more persons addicted.

263
00:17:42,844 --> 00:17:43,645
That's a big number.

264
00:17:44,666 --> 00:17:49,610
How do we compare the bad outcomes in the two cases?

265
00:17:50,391 --> 00:17:54,876
A very large increase in addiction with a very large decrease in crime.

266
00:17:54,896 --> 00:18:01,322
I take them both to be real, but I don't know how that's a value judgment.

267
00:18:01,582 --> 00:18:02,462
How do you, which is better?

268
00:18:02,642 --> 00:18:03,202
Which is better?

269
00:18:03,222 --> 00:18:04,183
Yeah, yeah.

270
00:18:04,203 --> 00:18:05,243
Right.

271
00:18:06,043 --> 00:18:09,724
And as for Rick, when it comes to the legalization, it's complicated for him.

272
00:18:10,024 --> 00:18:14,126
A lot of the reason Rick says he got into drugs in the first place was because he was illiterate.

273
00:18:14,526 --> 00:18:15,326
And I mean, think about that.

274
00:18:15,526 --> 00:18:20,327
Everything we've just heard, he ran a multi-million dollar business empire without being able to read and write.

275
00:18:20,768 --> 00:18:22,048
He learned to read and write in prison.

276
00:18:22,768 --> 00:18:28,652
And his basic take is, and a lot of academics would agree with him by the way, you need to attack the demand side of this equation.

277
00:18:28,892 --> 00:18:32,915
Try and reduce the reasons people want to use and sell crack in the first place.

278
00:18:33,435 --> 00:18:37,838
So that would mean addressing the desperation that drives people to become addicts or to drive them to become dealers.

279
00:18:38,378 --> 00:18:39,579
And that is Rick's new job.

280
00:18:39,599 --> 00:18:43,621
Since getting out of prison, he now travels around and talks to youth groups and schools.

281
00:18:44,162 --> 00:18:45,242
Anybody will have them basically.

282
00:18:45,302 --> 00:18:49,065
And he lays out the other side of this economic equation that you're in when you're a drug dealer.

283
00:18:49,585 --> 00:18:51,747
which is it's hard to retire as a drug dealer.

284
00:18:51,927 --> 00:18:57,251
You get shot or you go to prison, and once you go to prison, everything you've made, all the money you've made, it's gone.

285
00:18:57,271 --> 00:19:06,058
A multi-million dollar business that you've spent years and years building, developing expertise in, developing your connoisseurship for cocaine can all be gone in a second.

286
00:19:10,301 --> 00:19:18,668
After the break, we will bring in our summer school economists and we'll discuss what Ricky Ross, freeway Ricky Ross, can teach any entrepreneur about how to run a business.

We are back with Planet Money Summer School, class number three, Profit and Cocaine.

298
00:20:21,407 --> 00:20:27,732
And listening along with us are certified famous economists Betsy Stevenson and Justin Wolfers from the University of Michigan.

299
00:20:27,852 --> 00:20:28,273
Hi.

300
00:20:28,433 --> 00:20:28,693
Hey.

301
00:20:28,853 --> 00:20:31,815
So is Rick Ross, is he in a good business?

302
00:20:32,115 --> 00:20:36,359
Like is this the kind of situation that businesses dream about being in?

303
00:20:36,899 --> 00:20:43,084
Rick Ross is a good economist and that he is selling a product

304
00:20:44,377 --> 00:20:47,058
that has a characteristic economists call inelastic.

305
00:20:47,978 --> 00:20:51,379
When there's inelastic demand for something people keep buying it even when the price rises.

306
00:20:51,999 --> 00:20:54,100
So therefore the cops are boosting his bottom line.

307
00:20:54,400 --> 00:21:00,081
We should make sure we clearly define our vocabulary words here, inelastic demand.

308
00:21:00,301 --> 00:21:02,302
When we talked about demand last week,

309
00:21:03,063 --> 00:21:07,146
We said that for most products, when the price goes up, people buy less of the products.

310
00:21:07,226 --> 00:21:17,635
But there are a few products where there's not an easy substitute so that when the price goes up, people may buy a little less of it, but they will keep buying the product in elastic demand.

311
00:21:18,235 --> 00:21:19,016
That's exactly right.

312
00:21:19,396 --> 00:21:23,940
The amount by which high prices scare people away is not very much.

313
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:25,361
That's what inelastic means.

314
00:21:25,814 --> 00:21:31,578
And if you can find something with inelastic demand, I mean, that is a very good business opportunity.

315
00:21:31,838 --> 00:21:38,482
That's the good news for Mr. Ross, which is he can bump up his price of a fair bit and he's not going to lose many customers.

316
00:21:39,323 --> 00:21:42,204
And there's a different addictive substance that you talk about in your textbook.

317
00:21:43,445 --> 00:21:43,946
Coffee.

318
00:21:44,326 --> 00:21:44,926
Coffee.

319
00:21:45,366 --> 00:21:45,827
Coffee.

320
00:21:47,108 --> 00:21:53,492
And so coffee, some of us are in fact addicted and there are some national chains.

321
00:21:54,431 --> 00:21:58,713
that jack the price up and charge $4 for a venti latte.

322
00:21:59,573 --> 00:22:04,415
And that is taking advantage of my inelastic demand for coffee.

323
00:22:05,175 --> 00:22:15,839
But this was a big insight of Howard Schultz and Starbucks because 20 years ago, coffee did feel like this substance with an elastic demand.

324
00:22:15,899 --> 00:22:16,900
Like it was cheap.

325
00:22:16,940 --> 00:22:17,800
You could get it anywhere.

326
00:22:17,860 --> 00:22:20,441
It was generally kind of bad coffee.

327
00:22:20,981 --> 00:22:22,302
Nobody seemed to care that much.

328
00:22:22,835 --> 00:22:26,537
Right, but this comes to this idea of substitutability.

329
00:22:27,117 --> 00:22:33,399
Back then, when all coffee tasted terrible, there wasn't much of a difference between two different cups of coffee.

330
00:22:33,519 --> 00:22:39,042
So why would you pay more for the coffee at one diner versus the coffee at another diner?

331
00:22:39,702 --> 00:22:43,903
Coffee was treated almost the way we think about gasoline at different stations.

332
00:22:44,323 --> 00:22:50,825
So if you have the price of gas is much higher at a station across the street, then why would you buy from them?

333
00:22:51,005 --> 00:22:54,866
The gas between the two stations, it's going to fuel your car the same.

334
00:22:55,406 --> 00:23:00,408
Well, people used to think coffee, the two different cups of coffee, they're going to fuel my body the same.

335
00:23:01,088 --> 00:23:08,410
And the insight that Howard Schultz had was maybe there are actually some important product differences across coffee.

336
00:23:08,910 --> 00:23:18,573
He's also creating caffeine addictions, the greater those caffeine addictions, the more inelastic people's demand, and therefore the greater is his ability to raise prices.

337
00:23:19,454 --> 00:23:26,096
It's really important to Howard that you don't just want one coffee a day, that you need three and you need him no matter what the price.

338
00:23:26,876 --> 00:23:32,238
Which, if we're going to tell business stories, is also similar to Apple and the iPhone.

339
00:23:32,278 --> 00:23:32,778
There are

340
00:23:33,418 --> 00:23:50,570
substitutes but they've worked very hard to make you think if you're an apple phone user that that is a special object of which there is no substitute and which apparently you will spend hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of dollars on one of my kids smashed my iphone yesterday.

341
00:23:51,410 --> 00:23:56,233
And I just tried to buy an Android and Betty is yelling at me that I can't possibly do it.

342
00:23:56,393 --> 00:23:58,754
And I think she is something of an Apple addict.

343
00:23:59,294 --> 00:24:06,798
And I did try to point out that at the price of $1,000 for a phone, that perhaps her demand was a little too inelastic.

344
00:24:06,938 --> 00:24:09,400
And maybe I should try one of the lower priced alternatives.

345
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:12,961
You did just hit on an actual debate in our household.

346
00:24:13,062 --> 00:24:15,223
But it's also something Apple does this consciously.

347
00:24:15,363 --> 00:24:16,523
It's absolutely the case.

348
00:24:16,864 --> 00:24:18,945
It could make its product more useful.

349
00:24:19,965 --> 00:24:28,112
if it had an iMessage work with Android phones, but it would make an Android phone a closer substitute for an iPhone.

350
00:24:28,392 --> 00:24:41,403
I did think with Rick Ross, because he goes through this whole thing about, oh, his profit and the inelasticity and how much money he makes and the cost of supplies and everything.

351
00:24:41,863 --> 00:24:46,727
And you listen to it, you're like, well, why wouldn't everyone be in this business?

352
00:24:46,767 --> 00:24:47,788
This is a great

353
00:24:48,642 --> 00:24:50,083
great business to be at.

354
00:24:50,303 --> 00:24:52,184
You are aware we put drug dealers in prison.

355
00:24:53,445 --> 00:24:55,666
And that's a pretty bad lifestyle choice.

356
00:24:57,167 --> 00:25:01,310
There's another important concept here, which is what economists call barriers to entry.

357
00:25:01,890 --> 00:25:02,290
You're right.

358
00:25:02,650 --> 00:25:04,271
It sounds like Rick Ross was earning a lot of money.

359
00:25:04,652 --> 00:25:08,134
And so, Robert, maybe you and I should go and start our own drug dealing business.

360
00:25:08,854 --> 00:25:17,996
But I bet if we went to Rick Ross's corner and started trying to compete against him, it's not that he try and compete with us by lowering the price, he try and run us out of town using violence.

361
00:25:19,117 --> 00:25:23,138
So there are barriers to entering that market that keep competitors away.

362
00:25:23,438 --> 00:25:25,758
Which is also the sign of a good business to be in.

363
00:25:26,058 --> 00:25:26,539
Absolutely.

364
00:25:27,279 --> 00:25:31,840
And businesses repeatedly try to make it difficult for new companies to enter and compete against them.

365
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:36,543
And this actually explains a lot about how successful businesses work these days.

366
00:25:36,663 --> 00:25:48,071
I mean, companies may not use guns to defend themselves, but they use lawyers and regulations and lobbying to make sure that no one else is competing with them on the opposite corner.

367
00:25:48,591 --> 00:25:52,754
And in a lot of sectors of the economy, this is one of the main ways people compete.

368
00:25:53,154 --> 00:25:53,634
Absolutely.

369
00:25:53,854 --> 00:25:55,875
They'd rather not compete in terms of prices.

370
00:25:56,095 --> 00:26:02,976
What they want to do is compete in terms of constructing higher and higher barriers to entry, making it more and more difficult for newcomers to come in.

371
00:26:03,116 --> 00:26:06,837
So I'm thinking cable companies, car dealers, beer distributors?

372
00:26:07,477 --> 00:26:15,319
So they're running off to the government in their lobbying like hell saying, look, what we're distributing is so dangerous, you wouldn't want to let anyone else do it.

373
00:26:15,659 --> 00:26:17,639
but also doctors and hairdressers too.

374
00:26:17,659 --> 00:26:19,660
Like, do not try and compete with hairdressers.

375
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:21,720
My favorite is interior decorators.

376
00:26:22,321 --> 00:26:22,581
Really?

377
00:26:22,601 --> 00:26:29,222
In Florida, you have to get a license to become an interior decorator because a misplaced throw cushion could cause any amount of damage.

378
00:26:29,842 --> 00:26:31,543
Freeway Ricky Ross would be proud.

379
00:26:32,643 --> 00:26:37,104
He would be, and honestly, he's in the same business as some Florida interior decorators.

380
00:26:37,724 --> 00:26:42,666
So our assignment this week is to find a product that you think has inelastic demand.

381
00:26:43,306 --> 00:26:43,966
And tell us why.

382
00:26:44,646 --> 00:26:45,647
Are there no substitutes?

383
00:26:46,027 --> 00:26:47,188
How much would you pay for it?

384
00:26:47,208 --> 00:26:48,128
Would you pay anything for it?

385
00:26:48,769 --> 00:26:53,811
And if this is a brand name product, maybe there's a reason that this product doesn't have competitors, barriers to entry.

386
00:26:54,752 --> 00:26:57,093
Thank you very much, Jetsy.

387
00:26:57,253 --> 00:26:58,774
I think I tried to move your names together.

388
00:26:58,954 --> 00:27:01,196
Jetsy, we'll answer the Jetsy.

389
00:27:01,476 --> 00:27:04,037
Jetsy, thank you so much, Justin, to Betsy.

390
00:27:04,077 --> 00:27:04,538
Thanks, Robert.

391
00:27:06,726 --> 00:27:10,147
All right, students, let us know what you came up with from our assignment this week.

392
00:27:10,628 --> 00:27:14,289
Are there addictive products with inelastic demand that we have not thought of?

393
00:27:14,809 --> 00:27:26,054
Send your stories to PlanetMoney at npr.org or you can find us on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and we're doing special TikToks, reinforcing the economic lessons from summer school on the TikTok app.

394
00:27:26,454 --> 00:27:27,275
We're at PlanetMoney.

395
00:27:27,975 --> 00:27:35,016
Today's class was produced by Lauren Hodges with help from James Snead, Darian Woods, Alexi Horowitz-Gazi, Nick Fountain, and Liza Yeager.

396
00:27:35,516 --> 00:27:37,457
Our sound design was from Isaac Rodriguez.

397
00:27:37,797 --> 00:27:39,157
It was edited by Alex Goldmark.

398
00:27:39,857 --> 00:27:46,898
If, like me, you can't get enough of Betsy Stevenson and Justin Wolfers, later this summer they're releasing an audio course on the Hamalaya app.

399
00:27:47,178 --> 00:27:48,719
It's called Think Like an Economist.

400
00:27:49,299 --> 00:27:53,560
Remember, everyone, it is never too early to start studying for the test.

401
00:27:54,380 --> 00:27:55,540
I love it when professors say that.

402
00:27:56,302 --> 00:27:56,891
I'm Robert Smith.

403
00:27:57,033 --> 00:27:57,866
This is NPR.

404
00:27:58,353 --> 00:27:59,002
Thanks for listening.
