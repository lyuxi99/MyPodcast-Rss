00:00:00,111 --> 00:00:01,332
Hey everyone, Robert Smith here.

2
00:00:01,812 --> 00:00:07,596
At Planet Money, we cover the world of economics, but honestly, most of us at the show have never studied the subject.

3
00:00:08,077 --> 00:00:14,981
I personally keep a giant textbook right next to me on my desk for when I need to look up the difference between monopoly and monopsony.

4
00:00:15,442 --> 00:00:16,162
It's a real problem.

5
00:00:16,642 --> 00:00:18,784
So this July and August, we're trying something new.

6
00:00:19,024 --> 00:00:21,686
We are all going back to class.

7
00:00:22,086 --> 00:00:24,488
It's called Planet Money Summer School.

8
00:00:26,193 --> 00:00:29,108
which now that I hear it doesn't sound as fun as it's gonna be.

9
00:00:29,228 --> 00:00:30,816
So let's do this promo style.

10
00:00:39,717 --> 00:00:40,778
Here we go, Beach Party.

11
00:00:41,158 --> 00:00:42,498
Planet Money Summer School.

12
00:00:42,898 --> 00:00:45,739
All the economics you meant to learn, but didn't get around to.

13
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:56,083
We will have eight audio classes, one released every Wednesday, featuring our favorite Planet Money stories and lessons from some of the world's greatest and most charming economists.

14
00:00:56,423 --> 00:00:57,564
Economics is not about money.

15
00:00:58,084 --> 00:01:00,585
It's a lens of great power and beauty.

16
00:01:02,666 --> 00:01:06,007
And once you get the fundamental concepts, you will start to see them everywhere.

17
00:01:07,922 --> 00:01:08,342
the news.

18
00:01:08,883 --> 00:01:11,464
A small asteroid had entered the Earth's atmosphere.

19
00:01:11,565 --> 00:01:12,405
At the supermarket.

20
00:01:12,685 --> 00:01:19,130
Nobody wanted to go buy bacon soda because they felt like when they go in and buy the whole shelf of bacon soda that everybody knew what they was doing.

21
00:01:20,511 --> 00:01:22,332
And even the economics of your dating life.

22
00:01:22,612 --> 00:01:27,375
Each time she went home after the date and she would record one memorable detail.

23
00:01:27,616 --> 00:01:30,257
Pothead, touchy, boring.

24
00:01:31,178 --> 00:01:33,720
This guy had four gym memberships.

25
00:01:35,745 --> 00:01:40,849
Amuse your friends, win arguments, throw the words diminishing marginal utility into every discussion.

26
00:01:41,509 --> 00:01:48,875
And if you do some homework and pass the test at the end, we'll even put your name on a Planet Money Diploma-like certificate.

27
00:01:49,355 --> 00:01:52,898
Planet Money Summer School, new episodes every Wednesday this summer.

28
00:01:53,138 --> 00:01:58,923
And then on Fridays, just like always, we'll release a brand new episode on the economic crisis that we're living through right now.
