1
00:00:00,875 --> 00:00:01,495
Okay, everyone.

2
00:00:03,296 --> 00:00:07,899
Okay, everyone, this is NPR, phones down, eyes forward.

3
00:00:15,323 --> 00:00:21,506
Hello and welcome to Planet Money Summer School, the sweetest course in economics since that failed lemonade stand you had as a kid.

4
00:00:22,106 --> 00:00:25,208
This is class number two, markets and pickles.

5
00:00:26,379 --> 00:00:26,979
I'm Robert Smith.

6
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:33,561
Every Wednesday till Labor Day, we are meeting here in your ears to learn the essential principles of ECON 101.

7
00:00:34,662 --> 00:00:44,205
And if you pay attention and pass our final exam, we'll put your name on a summer school diploma that lawyers tell me is in no way to be considered a diploma.

8
00:00:44,985 --> 00:00:54,328
Hopefully you've spent the last week after class one thinking like an economist, waving your hand at past decisions and saying, sunk costs, get thee behind me.

9
00:00:55,218 --> 00:00:59,580
Today, we are going to hear about how markets pop up in the most unlikely places.

10
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:01,201
Those are the most exciting places.

11
00:01:01,221 --> 00:01:03,302
I can't wait to get looking for them.

12
00:01:03,702 --> 00:01:10,446
Listening along with us are professors extraordinaire from the University of Michigan, Justin Wolfers and Betsy Stevenson.

13
00:01:10,486 --> 00:01:10,686
Hey.

14
00:01:11,006 --> 00:01:11,146
Hey.

15
00:01:11,746 --> 00:01:11,786
Hi.

16
00:01:11,947 --> 00:01:12,487
Good to be here, mate.

17
00:01:12,747 --> 00:01:19,430
Today's show is about how individuals with very different needs and priorities get what they want through the magic of markets.

18
00:01:20,031 --> 00:01:24,173
And in a market, there is this constant dance between supply and demand.

19
00:01:24,813 --> 00:01:27,015
If you know one thing about Econ, it is probably this.

20
00:01:27,075 --> 00:01:34,601
There is an equilibrium, a price where the supply of a product or service meets the demand for that product or service.

21
00:01:35,441 --> 00:01:43,328
And I know we promise no charts and graphs for summer school, but just this once, we're going to do an audio chart with our voices.

22
00:01:44,128 --> 00:01:48,632
Justin, Justin will be supply, which goes up as the price increases.

23
00:01:51,753 --> 00:01:56,654
And what you heard there was the excitement that I have as a producer when there's a really high price.

24
00:01:56,894 --> 00:01:59,875
That excitement leads me to want to produce more and more.

25
00:02:00,355 --> 00:02:01,075
That's supply.

26
00:02:01,355 --> 00:02:03,296
Betsy, how did you demand?

27
00:02:03,896 --> 00:02:07,377
Betsy's giving me the glare that says, you know, I have a PhD.

28
00:02:13,978 --> 00:02:19,059
So prices are going up and as the prices are going up, the demand is falling.

29
00:02:19,519 --> 00:02:20,720
And so if supply goes up,

30
00:02:22,263 --> 00:02:28,246
And the man goes down, hmm, there's some note where they both meet and they hold that note.

31
00:02:28,546 --> 00:02:34,969
All right, I want everyone to keep that note of market balance in your mind as we listen to a story.

32
00:02:35,509 --> 00:02:39,791
Every week on summer school, we're gonna play you part of an episode that we found in our archives.

33
00:02:40,292 --> 00:02:45,214
And then afterwards, we're gonna get back together with our economists and discuss the economic theories behind it.

34
00:02:45,554 --> 00:02:49,116
Today, we'd like you to listen to a story of a market that was out of balance.

35
00:02:49,236 --> 00:02:51,097
No one was getting what they wanted.

36
00:02:51,897 --> 00:02:53,900
until someone figured out how to reorganize it.

37
00:02:54,240 --> 00:03:01,369
It was originally on our feedback in 2015, and it was called The Pickle Problem, hosted by Jacob Goldstein and Stacy Vanick-Smith.

38
00:03:01,989 --> 00:03:06,355
It's about 16 minutes long, and we will meet you back right here after it's done.

39
00:03:12,331 --> 00:03:18,435
About 10 years ago, Susanna Morgan was running a food bank in Alaska, and she really needed fresh produce.

40
00:03:18,875 --> 00:03:19,716
She always did.

41
00:03:20,356 --> 00:03:21,457
One day, the phone rang.

42
00:03:21,617 --> 00:03:24,819
It was this big national charity called Feeding America.

43
00:03:25,139 --> 00:03:29,262
Feeding America is this network of food banks all around the country, including Susanna's.

44
00:03:29,582 --> 00:03:33,625
And what they do is they get these big donations of food, and they figure out where they should go.

45
00:03:34,205 --> 00:03:36,307
On this call, they said they had a big donation for her.

46
00:03:36,667 --> 00:03:37,708
It was not fresh produce.

47
00:03:38,108 --> 00:03:40,910
It was a truckload of five gallon buckets of pickles.

48
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:43,631
You're kidding me, you're offering me pickles?

49
00:03:46,191 --> 00:03:52,253
And the feeding American person who said, yeah, I know, I know, I know, but you guys have been hanging out there at the top of the list for quite a while.

50
00:03:52,313 --> 00:03:56,034
And this is the first thing we've had that we think we'll really make it all the way to Alaska.

51
00:03:56,495 --> 00:03:57,515
And what did you do with them?

52
00:03:58,235 --> 00:04:02,916
We strong armed every soup kitchen we could find into taking pickles.

53
00:04:05,097 --> 00:04:08,919
Susanna would ask the people from Feeding America, why aren't we getting more fresh produce?

54
00:04:09,179 --> 00:04:16,403
Feeding America would say, well, we didn't offer you that truckload of oranges out of California because we thought the transportation would be too expensive.

55
00:04:16,483 --> 00:04:18,063
And I would say, ah!

56
00:04:18,584 --> 00:04:19,324
That scream there?

57
00:04:19,544 --> 00:04:28,488
That's because Susanna had set up her own transportation system so that if Feeding America had offered her fresh fruits or vegetables, she could get them trucked to Alaska really cheaply.

58
00:04:28,809 --> 00:04:31,630
But the people at the Feeding America Home Office didn't know that.

59
00:04:31,950 --> 00:04:33,873
And a lot of food banks had this problem.

60
00:04:34,213 --> 00:04:39,281
One food bank director in Idaho, my home state, complained that he got a truckload of potatoes.

61
00:04:39,741 --> 00:04:41,063
I mean, come on, it's Idaho.

62
00:04:41,183 --> 00:04:45,610
Of course, he already had a warehouse full of potatoes that had been donated by local farmers.

63
00:04:46,115 --> 00:04:50,058
This system had real consequences for hungry people all over the country.

64
00:04:50,439 --> 00:04:53,641
It meant that people in Alaska were not getting fresh produce.

65
00:04:53,661 --> 00:04:55,143
We're not getting, say, potatoes.

66
00:04:55,643 --> 00:04:59,747
And at the same time, the food bank in Idaho had too many potatoes and not enough other stuff.

67
00:04:59,947 --> 00:05:01,268
Everybody knew this was a problem.

68
00:05:01,548 --> 00:05:03,690
But for a long time, they just slipped with it.

69
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:07,793
And then, Susanna says, a new CEO came into feeding America.

70
00:05:08,294 --> 00:05:11,096
And as usual, what happens when you bring in a pair of fresh eyes?

71
00:05:11,156 --> 00:05:12,537
They look at something and say, hmm.

72
00:05:13,943 --> 00:05:16,664
I can't imagine why you guys are living with that system that sucks.

73
00:05:19,566 --> 00:05:20,826
Hello and welcome to Planet Money.

74
00:05:20,907 --> 00:05:21,707
I'm Jacob Goldstein.

75
00:05:21,987 --> 00:05:23,208
And I'm Stacy Vanick-Smith.

76
00:05:23,448 --> 00:05:31,452
Today on the show, how a bunch of food bank directors, including at least one socialist, tried to figure out a better way to get food to hungry people.

77
00:05:32,052 --> 00:05:33,173
Their bold experiment?

78
00:05:33,733 --> 00:05:34,473
The free market.

79
00:05:35,214 --> 00:05:36,494
Sort of free, anyway.

80
00:05:36,875 --> 00:05:37,655
Definitely a market.

81
00:05:42,164 --> 00:05:46,048

What does it mean to be the only person who looks like you at your place of work?

87
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:26,825
I was the first Latina in the newsroom at NPR ever to step foot who wasn't cleaning it.

88
00:06:27,288 --> 00:06:31,673
We discussed the reckoning over race taking place in newsrooms across the country.

89
00:06:32,313 --> 00:06:35,276
Listen and subscribe now to It's Been a Minute from NPR.

90
00:06:50,747 --> 00:06:59,170
Susanna and the other food bank directors start flying to Chicago every few months, sitting down in a room and talking about their own version of the pickle problem.

91
00:06:59,810 --> 00:07:02,371
And pretty soon, Susanna says, they get to the heart of it.

92
00:07:02,811 --> 00:07:06,032
It is a problem for someone else to make decisions for you.

93
00:07:06,572 --> 00:07:06,832
Right?

94
00:07:07,313 --> 00:07:13,799
It is a problem if somebody else is trying to decide whether this is something you need or not when they don't know what's in your inventory.

95
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:16,302
They don't know what your local donation supply is.

96
00:07:16,402 --> 00:07:21,427
They don't know what donated transportation you've arranged for or what your fundraising is at the moment.

97
00:07:21,847 --> 00:07:29,930
So to have a central office trying to make those decisions far away from those sources of knowledge led to all sorts of mismatches.

98
00:07:30,310 --> 00:07:36,333
When the economists in the room heard Susanna and her colleagues lay out the problem this way, they got very excited.

99
00:07:36,813 --> 00:07:40,754
Susanna remembers one economist in particular named Candace Prendagrest.

100
00:07:41,034 --> 00:07:49,918
Once we were able to lay it out in those clear terms, then Candace from the University of Chicago was able to say, well, sounds like an economic problem to me.

101
00:07:53,091 --> 00:07:56,553
There's this phrase in economics, the local knowledge problem.

102
00:07:56,813 --> 00:07:59,494
And it's why centrally planned economies don't work very well.

103
00:07:59,854 --> 00:08:13,962
No matter how smart the people in control are, whether they're in headquarters or the capital or the castle or whatever, they just don't have the knowledge to decide whether the people out in Alaska should get pickles or oranges.

104
00:08:14,522 --> 00:08:22,486
And when I talked to Canis, the economist who was in the room with Suzanne and the others, he told me the clear answer to the local knowledge problem is a market.

105
00:08:22,906 --> 00:08:25,047
a place where buyers and sellers come together.

106
00:08:25,408 --> 00:08:34,854
Because the beauty of a market, and in particular, the beauty of prices, is they show you how much different people, or in this case, different food banks, value different things.

107
00:08:35,294 --> 00:08:42,199
But Kanna says that roomful of food bankers was not very excited to hear his pitch for the virtues of the free market.

108
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:48,524
One of the food bankers, a wonderful guy called John Arnold came up to me and said, look, I'm a socialist.

109
00:08:48,904 --> 00:08:49,824
I have no interest in this.

110
00:08:49,905 --> 00:08:51,846
I listen to you, but I don't have any interest in this.

111
00:08:52,258 --> 00:08:58,784
I should mention that John Arnold passed away, but when I ran this quote by Susanna, she said, yeah, I could totally imagine John saying that.

112
00:08:59,385 --> 00:09:02,988
And anyway, John was not the only food banker who was wary of the market.

113
00:09:03,328 --> 00:09:05,470
I think many of them have the following sense.

114
00:09:05,891 --> 00:09:07,352
Markets are sometimes unfair.

115
00:09:07,933 --> 00:09:09,234
It benefits the powerful.

116
00:09:09,574 --> 00:09:10,515
It benefits the wealthy.

117
00:09:10,555 --> 00:09:11,636
It benefits the strong.

118
00:09:12,137 --> 00:09:17,702
Their focus is so much on the others, the ones who've been left behind.

119
00:09:17,982 --> 00:09:19,887
Left behind by markets, by the markets.

120
00:09:19,907 --> 00:09:20,408
By markets.

121
00:09:20,749 --> 00:09:24,798
And their great fear is that whatever we came up with would do the same.

122
00:09:25,199 --> 00:09:27,425
And if it did, they would prefer the old system.

123
00:09:27,715 --> 00:09:32,980
The idea of a market just seems fundamentally contrary to the spirit of food banks.

124
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,924
I mean, these are places that give away food for free to hungry people.

125
00:09:37,244 --> 00:09:41,308
And in any case, it wasn't like Feeding America could just sell food to the local food banks.

126
00:09:41,728 --> 00:09:47,754
One problem with that is the food banks in poor areas often have the hardest time raising money from local donors.

127
00:09:47,774 --> 00:09:51,297
They're in poor areas, so they wouldn't have enough money to buy the food.

128
00:09:51,637 --> 00:09:56,285
So Canis and the other economists asked the food bankers, what about fake money?

129
00:09:56,645 --> 00:10:04,098
What if Feeding America created its own little economy and gave out fake money to all the food banks which they could use to buy the food?

130
00:10:04,567 --> 00:10:11,831
Next question they said was, but how do we make sure the neediest get the most food, to which we said we give them the most fake money?

131
00:10:12,251 --> 00:10:18,935
And in some sense, maybe that was one of the early breakthrough moments, which was the idea that the poor can actually be wealthier than the rich.

132
00:10:19,475 --> 00:10:20,236
In fake money.

133
00:10:20,656 --> 00:10:22,057
In fake money, exactly.

134
00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:30,381
You could imagine distributing this fake money to the neediest places and then letting them buy, you know, whatever they want out of this national Feeding America system.

135
00:10:30,801 --> 00:10:33,083
But you still have to solve all these other problems.

136
00:10:33,123 --> 00:10:35,785
You know, what should prices be in this new fake money?

137
00:10:35,985 --> 00:10:37,987
How do you let everybody shop in a way that's fair?

138
00:10:38,327 --> 00:10:41,270
So more flights to Chicago, more meetings with the economists.

139
00:10:41,710 --> 00:10:44,252
And finally, Kanes and his colleagues came up with the big idea.

140
00:10:44,612 --> 00:10:45,153
Kanes said,

141
00:10:45,853 --> 00:10:47,394
Well, how about eBay?

142
00:10:47,955 --> 00:11:05,790
How would it work if we set up a system in which all of the food in truckloads that's donated goes on to a technology platform and the decision as to whether you want it for your food bank is made at the food bank and how much you want it is made by how much you bid on it?

143
00:11:06,612 --> 00:11:07,893
And how did that play in the room?

144
00:11:08,253 --> 00:11:10,475
The clouds opened and the angels sang.

145
00:11:11,376 --> 00:11:17,481
No, that never happened.

146
00:11:17,661 --> 00:11:26,829
Okay, maybe it wasn't quite that biblical, but it was literally this moment in which we just went, we have had a breakthrough.

147
00:11:27,129 --> 00:11:33,555
It was like setting up a whole economy, fake money, prices set by auctions, and with that key twist,

148
00:11:33,935 --> 00:11:38,280
The food banks that fed the most hungry people would get the most fake money.

149
00:11:40,523 --> 00:11:45,488
To see how the system works in real life, I went out to the community food bank in New Jersey last week.

150
00:11:45,829 --> 00:11:47,891
They have this huge warehouse out by the Newark Airport.

151
00:11:48,231 --> 00:11:49,493
Tristan Wallach gave me a tour.

152
00:11:50,407 --> 00:11:52,068
You can see some raisins up here.

153
00:11:52,789 --> 00:11:55,090
Canned salmon, you got some grapefruit juice.

154
00:11:56,231 --> 00:11:57,232
What else do we have there?

155
00:11:57,272 --> 00:11:58,533
We have some tomato sauce.

156
00:11:58,913 --> 00:12:03,036
Tristan says the most recent thing he bought at auction with that fake money is some syrup.

157
00:12:03,296 --> 00:12:08,820
The pancake syrup interested me in particular because I know we just bought some pancake mix.

158
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:14,382
So it's a moment when syrup was particularly valuable to you because you were a guy with pancake batter but no syrup.

159
00:12:14,562 --> 00:12:15,042
Exactly.

160
00:12:15,463 --> 00:12:20,125
So at least for now that means a lot of people in New Jersey can now have syrup with their pancakes.

161
00:12:20,445 --> 00:12:21,245
We'll cut up here.

162
00:12:21,585 --> 00:12:22,886
We can head back to the office.

163
00:12:23,566 --> 00:12:27,968
The office is a smallish room attached to the warehouse and it's where Tristan bids in these auctions.

164
00:12:28,388 --> 00:12:33,672
We get in there and he opens a browser on his computer, logs into the Feeding America system, and shows me this morning's auction.

165
00:12:34,132 --> 00:12:36,394
Down at the bottom of the page, there's a number in red.

166
00:12:36,774 --> 00:12:39,296
This is like Tristan's bank account of fake money.

167
00:12:39,736 --> 00:12:43,719
The money, by the way, has this warm, fuzzy-sounding name, shares.

168
00:12:44,219 --> 00:12:45,079
What does this say right here?

169
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:46,941
Yeah, it says available shares.

170
00:12:47,501 --> 00:12:48,642
At the moment, I have 5,439 shares.

171
00:12:48,662 --> 00:12:49,503
I view it as like monopoly money.

172
00:12:53,290 --> 00:12:55,132
except that it has real consequences.

173
00:12:55,652 --> 00:12:59,796
Every day, Feeding America gives Tristan some fake money in his bank account.

174
00:13:00,256 --> 00:13:04,640
And there's a formula so that the food banks that feed the most people will get the most fake money.

175
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:08,243
Yeah, on a typical day, Tristan's food bank gets a few thousand shares.

176
00:13:08,564 --> 00:13:09,725
You can think of it like an allowance.

177
00:13:09,845 --> 00:13:11,186
And he can treat it like an allowance.

178
00:13:11,326 --> 00:13:14,149
If he wants to spend it every day on something little, he can do that.

179
00:13:14,509 --> 00:13:17,432
If he wants to hoard it and splurge on something big, he can do that too.

180
00:13:17,955 --> 00:13:20,897
Today, he pulls up the oxygen on his computer, looks through the stuff.

181
00:13:20,917 --> 00:13:25,140
There's some phanta grape soda, some polio cheese, and then something catches his eye.

182
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:26,801
It's a truckload of cereal.

183
00:13:26,901 --> 00:13:30,703
Clicking on here, I can see that there's a lot of corn flakes.

184
00:13:30,903 --> 00:13:32,904
There's a little bit of frosted flakes on here.

185
00:13:33,565 --> 00:13:35,046
There's some kashi cereal.

186
00:13:35,286 --> 00:13:37,307
It's about 100,000 boxes and all.

187
00:13:37,547 --> 00:13:41,630
And he says cereal is something people always want and that he doesn't get enough of from his local donors.

188
00:13:42,052 --> 00:13:45,116
He can't actually see how much the other food banks are bidding.

189
00:13:45,396 --> 00:13:53,525
And Canis and Susanna and the others, they designed the system this way so that people couldn't just wait until the last second and bid one more fake dollar to get what they wanted.

190
00:13:53,946 --> 00:13:55,728
So it's a sealed bid auction.

191
00:13:55,948 --> 00:13:59,673
You put a number in and wait, and when the auction's done, you see if you won.

192
00:14:00,058 --> 00:14:05,962
The system does tell Tristan that, on average, truckloads of cereal like this one have sold for 4,400 shares.

193
00:14:06,402 --> 00:14:10,985
I currently have about 5,400 shares, so I'm gonna bid all of my shares.

194
00:14:11,085 --> 00:14:12,486
You're going all in for the cereal?

195
00:14:12,606 --> 00:14:18,030
Yeah, I'm gonna go all in, and even going all in, this is no guarantee that I'll get it.

196
00:14:18,330 --> 00:14:20,492
Tristan types in his bid, clicks Submit.

197
00:14:20,792 --> 00:14:23,994
Now it's a waiting game, crossing fingers and hoping for the best.

198
00:14:24,394 --> 00:14:29,478
I asked Tristan to show me some of the other stuff that sold at auction lately, and he pulled up a bunch of results on his screen.

199
00:14:29,858 --> 00:14:30,558
And what's this one?

200
00:14:30,798 --> 00:14:31,298
Pickles.

201
00:14:32,699 --> 00:14:33,179
Pickles.

202
00:14:33,479 --> 00:14:34,199
What was the price?

203
00:14:34,379 --> 00:14:36,279
They put in a bit of minus 2,000.

204
00:14:36,659 --> 00:14:38,000
Minus 2,000.

205
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:43,561
For stuff that's really unpopular, food banks don't want to pay to truck it in, and they don't want to find a place to store it.

206
00:14:44,001 --> 00:14:45,821
So they can bid negative shares.

207
00:14:46,122 --> 00:14:51,163
In other words, they can say, sure, I will take the pickles if you will give me extra fake money.

208
00:14:51,563 --> 00:14:52,903
That's what happened with the pickles.

209
00:14:53,282 --> 00:14:55,763
So they won it by saying, yeah, we'll take it off your hands if you pay us.

210
00:14:56,003 --> 00:14:56,723
Exactly.

211
00:14:56,923 --> 00:15:00,244
A few minutes after Tristan bid on that serial, this morning's auction is over.

212
00:15:00,484 --> 00:15:02,465
I think the results should be in if we.

213
00:15:02,885 --> 00:15:03,345
I'm nervous.

214
00:15:03,405 --> 00:15:03,946
Are you nervous?

215
00:15:04,026 --> 00:15:04,966
I'm a little nervous.

216
00:15:05,306 --> 00:15:06,386
Tristan hits refresh.

217
00:15:06,927 --> 00:15:07,807
So we lost it.

218
00:15:08,507 --> 00:15:09,127
You didn't get it.

219
00:15:09,247 --> 00:15:09,768
No.

220
00:15:10,028 --> 00:15:14,949
Someone else won this load with 11,564 shares.

221
00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:19,311
The winner bid twice as much as Tristan, someone in Evansville, Indiana.

222
00:15:21,672 --> 00:15:22,372
Can I see food bank?

223
00:15:22,894 --> 00:15:23,134
Yes, hi.

224
00:15:23,214 --> 00:15:24,636
I'm trying to reach John, please.

225
00:15:25,196 --> 00:15:25,717
This is him.

226
00:15:26,057 --> 00:15:32,043
This is John Strain of the Tri-State Food Bank, proud new owner of 100,000 boxes of cereal.

227
00:15:32,264 --> 00:15:35,487
Was there a particular reason right now that you especially wanted cereal?

228
00:15:35,507 --> 00:15:44,336
I just knew that we were down to basically about a half a turn or full of cereal and it goes, it probably will be gone in the next two weeks.

229
00:15:44,703 --> 00:15:54,029
John actually gets less fake money allowance every day than Tristan, but he'd been saving up for weeks and he was about to run out of cereal, this food that everybody really wants.

230
00:15:54,409 --> 00:15:58,031
At the breakfast, the supper, a midnight, it doesn't matter when you keep cereal, you know.

231
00:15:58,492 --> 00:16:02,054
You eat it dry, you eat it with milk, you know, whatever makes you happy.

232
00:16:02,294 --> 00:16:06,637
He figured it was worth it to go big, spend more than twice the average and get that cereal.

233
00:16:07,045 --> 00:16:11,307
If Tristan, in New Jersey, decides that he really needs cereal, he can save up too.

234
00:16:11,467 --> 00:16:15,189
Put his own monster bit up the next time more corn flakes come up for auction.

235
00:16:15,709 --> 00:16:21,372
John and Tristan are too new to remember much about that old system back when Feeding America just sent people stuff.

236
00:16:21,772 --> 00:16:25,014
But it seems like the new system is definitely an improvement.

237
00:16:25,454 --> 00:16:30,737
Susanna Morgan said the auction system meant they could finally get produce at the food bank in Alaska.

238
00:16:31,157 --> 00:16:36,600
And Canis, the economist, told me even John Arnold, the socialist from Michigan, even he came around in the end.

239
00:16:37,063 --> 00:16:41,371
He went from being the most skeptical to being somebody who actually thought it was worth doing.

240
00:16:41,731 --> 00:16:42,473
Wait, what happened?

241
00:16:43,340 --> 00:16:49,382
I think what he realized was the use of this market would give him access to a lot of really cheap food.

242
00:16:49,622 --> 00:16:57,064
So while other food banks were in bidding wars over cereal, John Arnold could swoop in and pick up the stuff that everybody else was ignoring.

243
00:16:57,444 --> 00:16:59,184
And he became what we call the bottom feeders.

244
00:16:59,504 --> 00:17:03,145
He was one of these guys who'd log in every morning, see what was cheap, get loads of it.

245
00:17:03,825 --> 00:17:09,487
And his solution was essentially the market allows me to get a lot of pounds of food in a way that I did not get before.

246
00:17:09,827 --> 00:17:16,669
And when Canis says John would log in and see what was cheap, he of course means what was cheap in fake money.

247
00:17:17,169 --> 00:17:28,652
And one of the really interesting things that has emerged from this system is just how different prices are in this fake money food bank economy compared to the real money economy we see at the grocery store.

248
00:17:29,055 --> 00:17:32,620
Like peanut butter is incredibly valuable in the food bank economy.

249
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:36,965
It lasts forever, it doesn't have to be refrigerated, and it is a great source of protein.

250
00:17:37,266 --> 00:17:38,207
Also, kids love it.

251
00:17:38,748 --> 00:17:41,832
A truckload of peanut butter can cost tens of thousands of shares.

252
00:17:42,232 --> 00:17:45,597
Dairy, on the other hand, really cheap in the food bank economy.

253
00:17:46,077 --> 00:17:48,318
Lots of food banks get local donations of dairy.

254
00:17:48,659 --> 00:17:52,061
They often have to move it pretty quickly because it has, you know, short expiration dates.

255
00:17:52,281 --> 00:17:54,482
It's harder to store because you have to keep it refrigerated.

256
00:17:54,842 --> 00:17:59,185
So up in Michigan, Kansas says John Arnold could buy a lot of dairy.

257
00:17:59,605 --> 00:18:03,768
And in the end, John Arnold really helped this system take off all around the country.

258
00:18:04,208 --> 00:18:12,173
He was a very persuasive figure because I think a lot of the other food bank director said, if he's in, I'm in because they thought he was unlikely to be a candidate to go along with this.

259
00:18:12,511 --> 00:18:15,537
If the socialist is in on the market system, how bad could it be?

260
00:18:16,039 --> 00:18:16,399
Exactly.

261
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:20,307
There was one part of the new system that did not work out.

262
00:18:20,918 --> 00:18:29,863
Yeah, when Canis and Susanna and the others were in that room creating this new system, they figured food banks should be able to sell food to each other for fake money.

263
00:18:30,263 --> 00:18:37,226
So that Idaho food bank with all the potatoes could sell them to Susanna in Alaska and get fake money to buy whatever they needed in Idaho.

264
00:18:37,827 --> 00:18:44,930
But even though the food bankers are okay with buying stuff for fake money, they don't really want to sell stuff to other food banks.

265
00:18:45,410 --> 00:18:48,632
Here's John Strain who bought the cereal for that food bank in Indiana.

266
00:18:48,995 --> 00:18:52,181
If I'm a food bank and I have extra product, I'm going to share with another food bank.

267
00:18:52,281 --> 00:18:54,385
I don't want no extra money, no nothing out of it.

268
00:18:54,785 --> 00:18:58,352
I've shared with five different food banks in the last 60 days.

269
00:18:58,592 --> 00:19:01,137
I just think you should share what you've got if you've got plenty.

270
00:19:01,435 --> 00:19:05,218
So, okay, food bank directors are fundamentally generous people.

271
00:19:05,278 --> 00:19:06,658
It's why they're running food banks, right?

272
00:19:06,678 --> 00:19:10,641
And that is part of the reason this corner of the market never took off.

273
00:19:11,101 --> 00:19:13,963
But Susanna Morgan says, there is something else at work.

274
00:19:14,003 --> 00:19:17,065
There's something subtler, really another kind of economy.

275
00:19:17,205 --> 00:19:19,567
This is a network built on relationships.

276
00:19:19,827 --> 00:19:24,210
If you work at a food bank, she says, you need to have friends at other food banks.

277
00:19:24,648 --> 00:19:27,150
You're going to rely on those people for more than just food.

278
00:19:27,170 --> 00:19:30,813
You're going to rely on those people for stealing their good fundraising practices.

279
00:19:31,253 --> 00:19:35,536
You're going to rely on those people for advertising the positions that you have open.

280
00:19:35,976 --> 00:19:41,720
So those people are your best source of learning and contacts.

281
00:19:41,901 --> 00:19:45,023
And you can use food as one of the ways you nurture those relationships.

282
00:19:45,423 --> 00:19:52,452
Susanna is now running the Oregon Food Bank, and she says she does occasionally use the system to sell food to other food banks, but not often.

283
00:19:52,873 --> 00:19:56,037
She says she would much rather just give it away to another food bank.

284
00:20:03,275 --> 00:20:06,298
That was Stacy Vanick-Smith and Jacob Goldstein from 2015.

285
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:13,667
Coming up on Planet Money Summer School, we will take the parable of the pickles and discuss it with our economists.

286
00:20:14,207 --> 00:20:19,393
Where do markets work best and when don't markets work at all after the break?

287
00:20:21,078 --> 00:20:23,940
From Miss Anne, to Becky, to Karen.

288
00:20:24,821 --> 00:20:25,742
Our very own Karen.

289
00:20:26,042 --> 00:20:26,742
Not that Karen.

290
00:20:26,882 --> 00:20:32,987
Karen Grigsby-Bates shares the evolution of the nickname for a certain kind of white woman.

291
00:20:33,367 --> 00:20:35,409
I'm looking forward to the next iteration.

292
00:20:35,769 --> 00:20:37,210
I want my name back.

293
00:20:37,571 --> 00:20:40,653
That's coming up on NPR's Code Switch.

296
00:21:03,432 --> 00:21:07,694
When we see a price tag on a product, we think of it in terms of money.

297
00:21:08,234 --> 00:21:11,315
But in the case of the food banks, the price wasn't about money.

298
00:21:11,696 --> 00:21:12,956
The price was about information.

299
00:21:13,476 --> 00:21:21,440
It was about communicating who wanted what, and it helped to find a balance between the supply of different types of food and the demand for each product.

300
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:24,261
There was a reason the pickles had a negative price.

301
00:21:24,981 --> 00:21:32,905
So now we wanted to spend a few minutes going over the lessons that we learned in the episode with our two resident economists, Justin Wolfers and Betsy Stevenson.

302
00:21:33,345 --> 00:21:33,966
Excited to do it.

303
00:21:34,306 --> 00:21:35,427
Yeah, it's nice to be here.

304
00:21:35,727 --> 00:21:48,158
You know, the thing that I loved about this episode was when you initially think of economics and auctions, you think of competition, like there are winners and there are losers.

305
00:21:48,938 --> 00:21:57,065
But you realize as you listen to the episode that because everyone wants and needs something different, it's not just about winners and losers.

306
00:21:57,105 --> 00:21:58,667
There's an opportunity to create

307
00:21:59,724 --> 00:22:00,885
more winners, if you will.

308
00:22:01,566 --> 00:22:04,688
So the technical expression for this is economists call this gains from trade.

309
00:22:05,429 --> 00:22:07,131
Stuff gets allocated to the people who want it most.

310
00:22:07,571 --> 00:22:09,152
I'll be honest, I find it kind of magical.

311
00:22:09,593 --> 00:22:11,895
All you have to do is change who gets what.

312
00:22:12,876 --> 00:22:15,598
And here we do it through markets and we create more joy in the world.

313
00:22:16,668 --> 00:22:17,649
Literally, more joy.

314
00:22:18,309 --> 00:22:20,011
Same amount of stuff, more joy.

315
00:22:20,171 --> 00:22:23,373
The market is figuring it out as it goes by itself.

316
00:22:23,854 --> 00:22:24,074
Right.

317
00:22:24,254 --> 00:22:25,335
Those aren't the technical terms.

318
00:22:25,615 --> 00:22:26,195
It's pretty much.

319
00:22:26,316 --> 00:22:27,376
What are the technical terms?

320
00:22:27,396 --> 00:22:28,918
That's pretty much the technical term.

321
00:22:29,018 --> 00:22:33,521
So no individual knows how much each person would value each good.

322
00:22:34,002 --> 00:22:38,025
So solving who shall get what to create the maximum amount of joy is an incredibly hard problem.

323
00:22:38,105 --> 00:22:41,527
In programming a computer, it would take years for the computer to solve it.

324
00:22:41,547 --> 00:22:43,409
This is just an immensely difficult thing.

325
00:22:44,114 --> 00:22:56,665
But a market is like a big calculator and it can aggregate all of this information and figure out a way by adjusting prices to making sure that each of the goods going to the food banks ends up at the food bank that wants it most.

326
00:22:56,976 --> 00:23:04,862
So what's remarkable is we're looking at one organization, a food bank, and we can see how big the knowledge problem is.

327
00:23:05,643 --> 00:23:11,268
No one at the top of the organization has enough information to be able to make good decisions.

328
00:23:11,368 --> 00:23:21,356
The top of the organization just doesn't know about the solution that the Alaskan food bank has worked out in terms of being able to ship from California.

329
00:23:21,816 --> 00:23:25,939
They don't know how many potatoes the Idaho Food Bank already has.

330
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:28,241
They just don't have that much information.

331
00:23:28,361 --> 00:23:34,426
And if we think that's hard to have within an organization, imagine if you were trying to do that for the entire economy.

332
00:23:34,706 --> 00:23:38,589
It's a colossal challenge and really no one's up to the task.

333
00:23:38,930 --> 00:23:50,659
Well, some people would probably say, well, you just need more computers and more inventory and more AI learning and figuring out who wants what in some sort of database option.

334
00:23:51,220 --> 00:23:59,146
Bottom line is that the information is too dispersed across society for it to be able to be aggregated together into one person.

335
00:23:59,867 --> 00:24:03,009
But what we do have in markets is prices.

336
00:24:03,570 --> 00:24:07,693
And prices plays the role of helping us aggregate that information.

337
00:24:08,173 --> 00:24:09,494
Price acts as a signal.

338
00:24:10,015 --> 00:24:20,063
So if we view the food bank market as this elegant solution to the problems of distribution they had, and it did work beautifully, but what can go wrong in a market?

339
00:24:20,765 --> 00:24:24,649
Well, there are a number of things that can occur that we call market failures.

340
00:24:25,290 --> 00:24:32,397
But perhaps the most relevant one to think about right now is how market power can undermine competitive pressures.

341
00:24:33,355 --> 00:24:49,264
In a normal market, we can think about a world where we don't have a bunch of different sellers competing with a bunch of different buyers, but perhaps we have only one primary buyer and lots of different sellers.

342
00:24:49,544 --> 00:24:51,285
People worry about that in the labor market.

343
00:24:51,305 --> 00:24:55,467
What if you're in a small town and Walmart's the only employer?

344
00:24:55,487 --> 00:25:00,650
That's one buyer and lots and lots of people trying to get a job.

345
00:25:01,670 --> 00:25:17,938
And so you can think who's going to have power in that relationship, who's going to be able to get a price that benefits them most, who's going to be able to try to extract as much of the benefits from that relationship as possible, it's going to be the one who has market power.

346
00:25:18,498 --> 00:25:25,482
We can think about it on the other side where perhaps there's one seller in many, many different buyers.

347
00:25:26,452 --> 00:25:31,753
Many people have noted that prices on Amazon seem to be going up during the pandemic.

348
00:25:32,454 --> 00:25:35,494
Amazon is a company that seems to have a lot of market power right now.

349
00:25:35,574 --> 00:25:39,575
Lots of people are turning to their computers and trying to order from Amazon.

350
00:25:39,595 --> 00:25:44,096
So you've got lots and lots of different buyers, not one seller.

351
00:25:44,136 --> 00:25:53,459
There's obviously alternatives, but that's a situation where it's easier for a company to extract higher profits out of their customers.

352
00:25:54,309 --> 00:25:59,875
Justin, are there places where a market can never work or shouldn't work?

353
00:25:59,975 --> 00:26:11,408
I mean, I don't know much about your own family, but you don't distribute love coupons that are tradable for hugs, and you don't have that sort of market-based economy just in your family.

354
00:26:12,112 --> 00:26:12,452
Do you?

355
00:26:13,672 --> 00:26:14,453
Currently, we don't.

356
00:26:16,293 --> 00:26:21,775
There's an SEC investigation at the moment of the snuggle market, and we had to suspend trading.

357
00:26:22,655 --> 00:26:26,116
But are there areas where you should not try and enforce a market solution?

358
00:26:26,536 --> 00:26:26,676
Right.

359
00:26:26,716 --> 00:26:31,998
So there are some areas where trust works really, really well, and that's why we do a lot of things in families.

360
00:26:33,712 --> 00:26:38,335
And there are some parts of markets where if people don't have trust, they work really, really poorly.

361
00:26:38,956 --> 00:26:43,479
Economists call this trust problem an information problem because what if you know something that I don't?

362
00:26:44,459 --> 00:26:50,163
If I don't trust you that you would tell me bad news about the product, then I start to worry you're trying to sell me a dud.

363
00:26:50,203 --> 00:26:58,989
So to give a really simple example, lots of people end up buying a used car from an aunt, an uncle, their parents, a brother or a sister.

364
00:26:59,749 --> 00:27:03,432
They do that because they know if it was a really crappy car, they'd probably get told.

365
00:27:04,588 --> 00:27:10,253
Whereas when you go down to the local use car lot, I've never met a used car salesman who said, look, the reason this one's cheap is because it's a dad.

366
00:27:11,374 --> 00:27:11,814
It's a limit.

367
00:27:12,495 --> 00:27:21,182
And so when one person knows something that the other doesn't, and there's not bombs of trust between them, that can really undermine markets.

368
00:27:21,222 --> 00:27:24,705
It's a big deal also in health insurance and healthcare markets as well.

369
00:27:25,063 --> 00:27:30,970
Let me give you another situation where people are typically not comfortable with markets.

370
00:27:31,751 --> 00:27:38,859
And that's for things where people feel like trading, particularly involving cash, would be repugnant.

371
00:27:39,519 --> 00:27:41,962
So we don't have a market for organs.

372
00:27:42,763 --> 00:27:52,147
You might need a new kidney, but it's not okay to go and say, hey, you got two, I'll give you 30 grand for one.

373
00:27:53,288 --> 00:27:57,610
That market is seen as just morally wrong.

374
00:27:57,870 --> 00:28:00,351
Although to be clear, a lot of economists think that's a mistake.

375
00:28:01,191 --> 00:28:04,633
If we offered people 30 grand for kidneys, we might get more kidneys.

376
00:28:04,893 --> 00:28:08,315
So there's this delicate dance between economics and ethics here.

377
00:28:08,995 --> 00:28:10,976
But those are places where

378
00:28:11,905 --> 00:28:20,772
you know, there are real ethical concerns about people who would, you know, think, you know, my, I got to put food on the table for my kids.

379
00:28:21,553 --> 00:28:25,836
And I don't, the market for my labor isn't working out very well.

380
00:28:25,976 --> 00:28:28,158
Maybe I should start selling off a kidney.

381
00:28:29,079 --> 00:28:36,725
That is a reason why there's lots of markets that we have tried to say, you know, we're just not comfortable with this.

382
00:28:37,105 --> 00:28:38,567
The technical term is icky.

383
00:28:40,489 --> 00:28:41,289
Icky.

384
00:28:41,369 --> 00:28:50,599
That's going to be one of our vocabulary words for the day, icky, as well as the phrase local knowledge problem, where people at the top of an organization don't know what's happening down at the bottom.

385
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:58,527
And the phrase gains from trade, which Justin used, where if you allow people to voluntarily trade, everyone can get happier.

386
00:28:58,607 --> 00:29:00,068
There's just more joy in the world.

387
00:29:00,669 --> 00:29:09,716
So one thing we wanted to do each week is to give you the summer school student an assignment, something you can think about during the week about applying these lessons to your life, Justin.

388
00:29:10,216 --> 00:29:25,307
My assignment for summer school, take a look at an organization that you really admire and ask yourself, is it organized more like the way fitting America used to be organized with a centralized planner, making decisions that affect the rest of the organization, possibly based on incomplete information?

389
00:29:26,158 --> 00:29:36,823
Or is it organized more like Feeding America was after reorganized around markets where power left the executive office instead was devolved to individual decision makers to buy and sell in markets?

390
00:29:37,804 --> 00:29:49,910
And then once you've thought which of those two models your organization fits in, try and imagine what it would look like the other way and ask yourself whether it could be more effective if it reorganized the other way.

391
00:29:57,484 --> 00:30:01,607
Okay listener, you have your assignment and let's take a look at the syllabus.

392
00:30:01,927 --> 00:30:11,435
We will be back next Wednesday with a class where we consider price elasticity and barriers to entry by talking to a drug dealer.

393
00:30:12,316 --> 00:30:13,237
Thank you Justin Betsy.

394
00:30:13,517 --> 00:30:14,838
It's gonna be so fun next week.

395
00:30:16,392 --> 00:30:19,495
Do let us know what you came up with from our assignment this week.

396
00:30:19,955 --> 00:30:22,898
Remember it was taken organization, maybe one where you work.

397
00:30:23,499 --> 00:30:29,564
And imagine how it would work better if you reorganized it with more or less central decision making.

398
00:30:30,045 --> 00:30:33,788
And then you should send that idea to your boss and to us here at PlanetMoney.

399
00:30:33,848 --> 00:30:36,010
We're PlanetMoney at npr.org.

400
00:30:36,771 --> 00:30:43,153
or you can find us on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and we are doing special TikToks on the TikTok app.

401
00:30:43,634 --> 00:30:47,875
Reinforcing the economic lessons from summer school, you can find us there at Planet Money.

402
00:30:48,556 --> 00:30:55,738
Today's class was produced by Lauren Hodges with help from James Snead, Darian Woods, Alexi Horowitz-Gazi, Nick Fountain, and Liza Yeager.

403
00:30:56,158 --> 00:30:57,699
Sound design from Isaac Rodriguez.

404
00:30:58,219 --> 00:30:59,800
The show was edited by Alex Goldmark.

405
00:31:00,380 --> 00:31:08,664
Betsy Stevenson and Justin Wolfers are professors of economics and public policy at the University of Michigan, and later this summer they will debut a new audio course.

406
00:31:09,184 --> 00:31:12,765
It's called Think Like An Economist, and you can find it on the Himalaya app.

407
00:31:13,506 --> 00:31:15,646
Alright everyone, do your homework, study for the test.

408
00:31:15,666 --> 00:31:18,007
I'm Robert Spiff, this is NPR.

409
00:31:18,348 --> 00:31:18,968
Thanks for listening.
