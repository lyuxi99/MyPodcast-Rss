      <description><![CDATA[If you believe the hype, translators will all soon be out of work.

      <title>The Indicators of this year and next</title>
      <description><![CDATA[This year, there was some economic good news to go around. Inflation generally ticked down. Unemployment more or less held around 4-percent. Heck, the Fed even cut interest rates three times. But for a lot of people, the overall economic vibes were more important. And the vibes... were still off.<br/><br/>We might have achieved the soft landing the Fed was hoping for, but we saw some wackiness in the relationship between unemployment and job vacancies. Meanwhile, Bitcoin went to the moon. We have covered all of that in this past year, but which of these economic stories really <em>defined</em> the year?<br/><br/>Fortunately, we don't have to decide. You all do.<br/><br/>On today's show, a collaboration with our daily podcast The Indicator, we have Indicator Family Feud! Two Planet Money hosts enter, one Indicator host... also enters. And all three leave, having had a great time with lively discussion and light ribbing. Plus, some mild scheduling issues. But, we can't stress enough that no hosts were harmed in the making of this podcast.<br/><br/>Then, we look ahead to 2025 to see what indicators we think will define the coming year – the future and the past, on our latest episode!<br><em><br>Help support </em>Planet Money<em> and hear our bonus episodes by subscribing to </em>Planet Money<em>+ </em><a href="http://n.pr/PM-digital"><em>in Apple Podcasts</em></a><em> or at </em><a href="https://n.pr/3HlREPz"><em>plus.npr.org/planetmoney</em></a><em>.</em><br/><br/>Learn more about sponsor message choices: <a href="https://podcastchoices.com/adchoices">podcastchoices.com/adchoices</a><br/><br/><a href="https://www.npr.org/about-npr/179878450/privacy-policy">NPR Privacy Policy</a>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Our planet is in serious trouble. There are a million species of plants and animals in danger of extinction, and the biggest cause is companies destroying their habitats to farm food, mine minerals, and otherwise get the raw materials to turn into the products we all consume.<br/><br/>So, when Mauricio Serna was in college, he realized his family's plot of land in Colombia, called <em>El Globo</em>, presented a unique opportunity. Sure, it had historically been a cattle ranch. But if he could get the money to turn it back into cloud forest, perhaps it could once again be a habitat for the animals who used to live there — animals like the yellow-eared parrot, the tree ocelot, and the spectacled bear (of <em>Paddington</em> fame).<br/><br/>On today's show, Mauricio's quest to make a market for a new-ish financial instrument: the biodiversity credit.

      <title>How sports gambling blew up</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Sports gambling isn't exactly a financial market, but it rhymes with financial markets. What happens on Wall Street somehow eventually also happens in sports gambling. So in the 1980s, when computers and deep statistical analysis entered the markets, it also entered the sportsbooks and changed the world of sports gambling in ways we see every day now.<br/><br/>On today's episode, we have a story from Michael Lewis' new season of his podcast <em>Against The Rules</em>. We hear from a bookie who was able to beat the odds using statistical analysis, and the <em>other</em> bookie who managed to beat <em>those</em> odds, using an even more subtle science: behavioral analysis. Plus, how it's harder than ever to win against the house, and why those offers of free bets in TV ads are maybe not such a good idea.<br/><br/><em>This episode was hosted by Michael Lewis and Mary Childs. Our version of the podcast was produced by Emma Peaslee and edited by Martina Castro. It was fact checked by Sierra Juarez, and engineered by Cena Loffredo.

So in the 1980s, when computers and deep statistical analysis entered the markets, it also entered the sportsbooks and changed the world of sports gambling in ways we see every day now.<br/><br/>On today's episode, we have a story from Michael Lewis' new season of his podcast <em>Against The Rules</em>. We hear from a bookie who was able to beat the odds using statistical analysis, and the <em>other</em> bookie who managed to beat <em>those</em> odds, using an even more subtle science: behavioral analysis. Plus, how it's harder than ever to win against the house, and why those offers of free bets in TV ads are maybe not such a good idea.<br/><br/><em>This episode was hosted by Michael Lewis and Mary Childs.

      <title>A Nobel prize for explaining why there's global inequality</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Why do some nations fail and others succeed?<br/><br/>In the late 1990s and early 2000s, three economists formed a partnership that would revolutionize how economists think about global inequality.

In other words, the economists shined a spotlight on the power of institutions, the systems, rules, and structures that shape society.<br/><br/>We spoke with two of the Nobel-winning economists about their research on why some countries are rich and others are poor, why it took so long for economics to recognize the power of institutions, and what the heck those even are.<br/><br/><em>This episode was hosted by Jeff Guo and Greg Rosalsky.

      <title>There Will Be Flood</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Windell Curole spent decades working to protect his community in southern Louisiana from the destructive flooding caused by hurricanes. His local office in South Lafourche partnered with the federal government's Army Corps of Engineers to build a massive ring of earthen mounds – also known as levees – to keep the floodwaters at bay.<br/><br/>But after Hurricane Katrina called into question the integrity of those levees, Windell decided to take a gamble that put him at odds with his partners in the Army Corps. He decided that the best thing he could do to protect his community was to go rogue and build his levees as tall as possible as quickly as possible, without federal permission.<br/><br/>On today's show, what the story of Windell's levee can teach us about how the federal government calculates and manages the risk of natural disasters, and how those calculations can look a lot different to the people staring straight into the eye of the storm.<br/><br/><em>This episode was hosted by Alexi Horowitz-Ghazi and Mary Childs.

On today's episode, Kenny Malone pulls out a data breach letter he received and goes over what it recommends with Amanda Aronczyk.

The process went like it usually did: Lots of paperwork; a virtual closing. Pretty cut-and-dry. Gina and her partner started building a house on the property.<br/><br/>But $800,000 into the construction process, Gina got a troubling call from her lawyer. There was something wrong. At first, Gina thought the house had burned down. It turned out that the situation was... maybe worse.<br/><br/>On today's show: Buying land seems pretty secure, right?

      <title>The great German land lottery</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Every ten years, a group of German farmers gather in the communal farm fields of the Osing for the <em>Osingverlosung</em>, a ritual dating back centuries. <em>Osing </em>refers to the area. And <em>verlosung</em> means "lottery," as in a land lottery. All of the land in this communal land is randomly reassigned to farmers who commit to farming it for the next decade.<br/><br/>Hundreds of years ago, a community in Germany came up with their own, unique solution for how to best allocate scarce resources. For this community, the lottery is a way to try and make the system of land allotment more fair and avoid conflict.<br/><br/>Today on the show, we go to the lottery and follow along as every farmer has a shot at getting the perfect piece of land — or the absolute worst piece of land! And we see what we can learn from this living, medieval tradition that tries to balance fairness and efficiency.<br/><br/><em>This episode was hosted by Erika Beras and Emma Peaslee.

      <title>The strange way the world's fastest microchips are made</title>
      <description><![CDATA[This is the story behind one of the most valuable — and perhaps, most improbable — technologies humanity has ever created. It's a breakthrough called extreme ultraviolet lithography, and it's how the most advanced microchips in the world are made. The kind of chips powering the latest AI models. The kind of chips that the U.S. is desperately trying to keep out of the hands of China.<br/><br/>For years, few thought this technology was even possible. It still sounds like science fiction: A laser strong enough to blast holes in a bank vault hits a droplet of molten tin. The droplet explodes into a burst of extreme ultraviolet light. That precious light is funneled onto a wafer of silicon, where it etches circuits as fine as a strand of DNA. Only one company in the world that can make these advanced microchip etching machines: a Dutch firm called ASML.<br/><br/>Today on the show, how this breakthrough in advanced chipmaking happened — and how it almost didn't. How the long-shot idea was incubated in U.S. nuclear weapons laboratories and nurtured by U.S. tech giants. And, why a Dutch company now controls it.<br/><br/><em>This episode was hosted by Jeff Guo and Sally Helm. It was produced by Willa Rubin and edited by Jess Jiang.

      <title>What markets bet President Trump will do</title>
      <description><![CDATA[On the day after the election, Wall Street responded in a dramatic way. Some stocks went way up, others went way down.

      <title>The veteran loan calamity</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Ray and Becky Queen live in rural Oklahoma with their kids (and chickens). The Queens were able to buy that home with a VA loan because of Ray's service in the Army. During COVID, the Queens – like millions of other Americans – needed help from emergency forbearance. They were told they could pause home payments for up to a year and then pick up again making affordable mortgage payments with no problems.<br/><br/>That's what happened for most American homeowners who took forbearance. But not for tens of thousands of military veterans like Ray Queen.<br/><br/>On today's show, we follow two reporters' journey to figure out what went wrong with the VA's loan forbearance program. How did something meant to help vets keep their houses during COVID end up stranding tens of thousands of them on the brink of foreclosure? And, once the error was spotted, did the government do enough to make things right?<br/><br/><em>Today's episode was produced by James Sneed. It was edited by Meg Cramer.

      <title>Why do hospitals keep running out of generic drugs?</title>
      <description><![CDATA[There's something strange going on in hospitals. Cheap, common drugs that nurses use every day seem to be constantly hit by shortages. These are often generic drugs that don't seem super complicated to make, things like dextrose and saline (aka sugar water and salt water).<br/><br/>So what's going on?

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[There's something strange going on in hospitals. Cheap, common drugs that nurses use every day seem to be constantly hit by shortages.

      <title>Romance on the screen and on the page: Two Indicators</title>
      <description><![CDATA[On today's show, we have two stories from <em>The Indicator</em>, <em>Planet Money</em>'s daily podcast. They just launched Love Week, a weeklong series exploring the business and economic side of romance.<br/><br/>First, hosts Wailin Wong and Adrian Ma fire up the gas logs and pour a mug of cocoa to discuss the made-for-TV rom-com machine, and how television executives learned to mass produce seasonal romance.<br/><br/>Then, Wailin and host Darian Woods discuss another romance medium: the romance novel. Once relegated to supermarket aisles, these books are now mainstream. And authors, an often-maligned group within publishing, have found greater commercial success than many writers in other genres. We find out how romance novelists rode the e-book wave and networked with each other to achieve their happily-for-now status in the industry.<br/><br/><em>This episode is hosted by Erika Beras, Wailin Wong, Adrian Ma, and Darian Woods.

      <title>The Subscription Trap</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Over the past two decades, there's been a sort of tectonic economic shift happening under our feet. More and more companies have switched from selling goods one by one to selling services, available as a subscription. These days everything from razor blades to meal kits to car washes have become subscriptions. But all that convenience has also come with a dark side – some companies have designed their offerings to be as easy as possible to sign up for and also as difficult as possible to cancel. Many consumers are now paying for way more subscriptions than they even know about.<br/><br/>On today's show, we discover how we all fell into this subscription trap – who is winning and who is losing in this brave new subscription based world – and what both the government and the free market are doing to try and fix it.<br/><br/><em>This episode was hosted by Alexi Horowitz-Ghazi and Jeff Guo.

      <title>Can cap and trade work in the US?</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Recently, the state of Washington embarked on an ambitious new plan to combat climate change. Taking a page from economics textbooks, the state instituted a statewide "cap and trade" system for carbon emissions. The state establishes a <em>cap</em> on the total amount of carbon pollution it is willing to allow each year, and then gives away or auctions off carbon emission permits that add up to that total. Companies can then <em>trade </em>those permits on the open market.<br/><br/>Economists love cap and trade plans because they establish a limit on carbon emissions while letting the market find the most efficient way for decarbonization to occur. But cap and trade has had a hard time catching on, especially in the U.S.<br/><br/>The stakes are high for Washington's new plan. If it succeeds, it could convince other states to implement their own versions, but if it fails, it might serve as a cautionary tale.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[Recently, the state of Washington embarked on an ambitious new plan to combat climate change. Taking a page from economics textbooks, the state instituted a statewide "cap and trade" system for carbon emissions. The state establishes a <em>cap</em> on the total amount of carbon pollution it is willing to allow each year, and then gives away or auctions off carbon emission permits that add up to that total. Companies can then <em>trade </em>those permits on the open market.<br/><br/>Economists love cap and trade plans because they establish a limit on carbon emissions while letting the market find the most efficient way for decarbonization to occur. But cap and trade has had a hard time catching on, especially in the U.S.<br/><br/>The stakes are high for Washington's new plan. If it succeeds, it could convince other states to implement their own versions, but if it fails, it might serve as a cautionary tale. On today's show, we take a look at how Washington's grand experiment with cap and trade is faring.<br/><br/><em>This episode was hosted by Keith Romer and Kenny Malone.

Why does Walz support universal free school lunches, and why do some criticize him for it? Why have some called Vance a "Khan-servative?" And, how much do these candidates represent a break from the past?<br/><br/><em>This episode was hosted by Nick Fountain and Greg Rosalsky. It was produced by James Sneed and Emma Peaslee.

      <title>How to save 10,000 fingers</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Table saws are extremely dangerous. The government estimates that injuries from table saws send something like 30,000 people to the emergency room every year. 3,000 of those end in amputations. The costs of those injuries are enormous. Are they also avoidable?<br/><br/>In 1999, inventor Steve Gass had a realization: Humans conduct electricity pretty well; Wood does not. Could he develop a saw that could tell the difference between the two?<br/><br/>Steve invented a saw that can detect a finger and stop the blade in milliseconds. Then, he tried to license it to the big tool companies. He thought it was a slam dunk proposition: It would dramatically reduce the injuries, and the cost of medical treatments and lost wages associated with them.<br/><br/>On today's episode: What does it take to make table saws safer? When someone gets hurt by a power tool, there are tons of costs, tons of externalities. We all bear the cost of the injury, in some way. So, it can be in society's best interest to minimize those costs. We follow Steve's quest to save thousands of fingers. It brought him face-to-face with roomfuls of power tool company defense attorneys, made him the anti-hero of the woodworking world, and cost the lives of many, many hot dogs.<br><em><br>Help support Planet Money and hear our bonus episodes by subscribing to Planet Money+ </em><a href="http://n.pr/PM-digital"><em>in Apple Podcasts</em></a><em> or at </em><a href="https://n.pr/3HlREPz"><em>plus.npr.org/planetmoney</em></a><em>.</em><br/><br/>Learn more about sponsor message choices: <a href="https://podcastchoices.com/adchoices">podcastchoices.com/adchoices</a><br/><br/><a href="https://www.npr.org/about-npr/179878450/privacy-policy">NPR Privacy Policy</a>]]></description>

      <title>Can money buy happiness?</title>
      <description><![CDATA[People often say that money can't buy you happiness. Sometimes, if you ask them to tell you more about it, they'll mention a famous 2010 study by Nobel Prize winners Daniel Kahneman and Angus Deaton. That study found that higher household income correlates with greater emotional well-being, but only up to around $75,000 a year. After that, more money didn't seem to matter.<br/><br/>This was a famous study by two famous academics. The result stood for over a decade. And it feels good, right? Maybe the rich aren't so much happier than anyone else. But researchers have recently done a complete 180 on this idea. In 2021, psychologist Matt Killingsworth found nearly the opposite: That more money <em>does</em> correlate with more happiness. And that the relationship continues well beyond $75,000 per year.<br/><br/>Today on the show: Does more money mean <em>fewer</em> problems? Two researchers with totally different takes come together to hammer out a better understanding of the relationship between money and happiness.<br/><br/><em>This episode was hosted by Sally Helm and Nick Fountain.

      <title>99 Percent Invisible: The White Castle System of Eating Houses</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Today we have a guest episode from <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/99-invisible/id394775318"><em>99 Percent Invisible</em></a>.<br/><br/>It is about White Castle, the burger chain. Even if you haven't visited, you have tasted its influence because, as we will learn in this episode, White Castle is really the proto-burger chain.<br/><br/>Our friends at the excellent podcast <em>99 Percent Invisible</em> bring us the origin story of White Castle and trace its influence on the business of fast food, and on American eating habits. The story is about one man who had an idea for a world where you could get a slider anywhere in the country and get the same tasty, onion-y quality each time. Think of this as a forebear of the modern global economy of sameness.<br/><br/><em>This episode is hosted by Roman Mars and reported by Mackenzie Martin.

      <title>Is AI overrated or underrated?</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Are the promises made by AI boosters all hype, or are we actually under-appreciating the transformative potential of AI?<br/><br/>Can artificial intelligence make humans more productive, unlock hidden potential and remake work as we know it? Or, should it not even be called intelligence at all, artificial or otherwise.<br/><br/>On today's episode, we take sides.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[Are the promises made by AI boosters all hype, or are we actually under-appreciating the transformative potential of AI?<br/><br/>Can artificial intelligence make humans more productive, unlock hidden potential and remake work as we know it? Or, should it not even be called intelligence at all, artificial or otherwise.<br/><br/>On today's episode, we take sides.

      <title>Summer camp capitalism</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Summer camp is a classic rite of passage in the U.S. It's a place of self-discovery, where kids come to make new friends and take on new challenges. But what if it were ALSO a place where children came to learn how to survive in a free market economy?<br/><br/>That's part of the idea behind a summer camp at JA BizTown, in Portland, Oregon. Kids at the camp run tiny fake businesses in a tiny fake town. There are retail stores and restaurants, insurance companies and power utilities. As camp begins, a gaggle of child CEOs take out business loans from their peers in the tiny fake banking industry – and they spend the day racing to run their businesses profitably enough to get out of debt before pickup time. <br/><br/>On today's show, Planet Money takes a romp through capitalism summer camp. Will the children of BizTown be able to make ends meet and pay back their loans to the banks? Or will a string of defaults send this dollhouse economy into financial collapse? It's Shark Tank meets Lord of the Flies.<br/><br/><em>This episode was hosted by Alexi Horowitz-Ghazi and Sally Helm. It was produced by James Sneed, and edited by Jess Jiang.

      <title>The trade fraud detective</title>
      <description><![CDATA[When David Rashid took over US autoparts maker Plews and Edelmann, the company was losing business to its Chinese rival, Qingdao Sunsong. Both companies make power steering hoses, but Sunsong was offering its hoses to retailers at a much lower price.<br/><br/>Then, in 2018, the Trump administration threw companies like Rashid's a lifeline, by announcing tariffs on a range of Chinese goods, including some autoparts. Rashid thought the tariffs would finally force Sunsong to raise its prices, but, somehow, the company never did.<br/><br/>It was a mystery. And it led Rashid to take on a new role – amateur trade fraud investigator. How could his competitor, Sunsong, absorb that 25% tax without changing its prices? And why had all of Sunsong's steering hoses stopped coming from China and started coming from Thailand?<br/><br/>On today's episode, the wide gulf between how tariffs work in theory... and how they actually work in practice. And David Rashid's quest to figure out what, if anything, he could do about it. It's a quest that will involve international detectives, forensic chemists, and a friendship founded on a shared love for hummus.<br/><br/><em>This episode was hosted by Keith Romer and Jeff Guo.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[When David Rashid took over US autoparts maker Plews and Edelmann, the company was losing business to its Chinese rival, Qingdao Sunsong. Both companies make power steering hoses, but Sunsong was offering its hoses to retailers at a much lower price.<br/><br/>Then, in 2018, the Trump administration threw companies like Rashid's a lifeline, by announcing tariffs on a range of Chinese goods, including some autoparts. Rashid thought the tariffs would finally force Sunsong to raise its prices, but, somehow, the company never did.<br/><br/>It was a mystery. And it led Rashid to take on a new role – amateur trade fraud investigator. How could his competitor, Sunsong, absorb that 25% tax without changing its prices? And why had all of Sunsong's steering hoses stopped coming from China and started coming from Thailand?<br/><br/>On today's episode, the wide gulf between how tariffs work in theory... and how they actually work in practice. And David Rashid's quest to figure out what, if anything, he could do about it. It's a quest that will involve international detectives, forensic chemists, and a friendship founded on a shared love for hummus.<br/><br/><em>This episode was hosted by Keith Romer and Jeff Guo.

      <description><![CDATA[You might have seen ads for online banking services that seem to offer a lot of great stuff — accounts you can open in minutes and without a minimum balance or monthly fees.

And this is a story about the potential risks of putting your money into these apps.<br/><br/>Banks go through a whole regulatory gauntlet in order to exist.

      <title>Will the Olympics break breakdancing?</title>
      <description><![CDATA[For some sports, picking the winner is simple: It's the athlete who crosses the finish line first, or the side that scores the most goals. But for the new Olympic sport of breaking (if you want to be cool, don't call it breakdancing), the criteria aren't quite that straightforward. How do you judge an event whose core values are dopeness, freshness, and breaking the rules? <br/><br/>That was the challenge for Storm and Renegade, two legendary b-boys who set out to create a fair and objective scoring system for a dance they say is more of an art than a sport. Over the years, their journey to define the soul of breaking led them to meetings with Olympics bigwigs, debates over the science of dopeness, and a battle with a question many sports — from figure skating to gymnastics — have tried to answer: Can art and sport coexist? <br/><br/><em>This episode was hosted by Jeff Guo and Alexi Horowitz-Ghazi.

We start with one of the founding texts of economics, <em>Wealth of Nations, </em>in which Adam Smith argues a country's true value is not measured in gold and silver, but by its people's ability to buy things that enhance their standard of living. Then we'll watch American politicians completely ignore that argument in favor of protecting domestic industries – until one congressman makes a passionate case for free trade as the means to world peace.

      <title>What to do when you're in a class action</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Maybe you got a boring slip of paper in the mail. Maybe you got a spammy-looking email promising you money. Surprise! You're in a class action. If you've done any commerce in the last decade, there's a good chance that someone somewhere was suing on your behalf and you have real money coming your way... if you know what to do.<br/><br/>Class action settlements are on the rise. And, on today's show, we're helping decipher the class action from the perspective of the average class member. How do class actions work? Why are these notices sometimes undecipherable? And, what do you stand to gain (or lose) by responding? <br/><br/><em>This episode was hosted by Kenny Malone and Nick Fountain. It was produced by James Sneed with help from Sam Yellowhorse Kesler.

Should there be a centralized bank? Should there be a single currency? We'll travel to two moments in the country's early history when the founders said "nope" to these questions and see what happened. <br/><br/>First we'll witness one of the great economic battles in U.S. history – the president of the United States versus the president of the <em>Bank</em> of the United States – and see how the outcome ushered in an age of financial panics. Then we'll drop in on a time before the U.S. dollar existed as we know it, when you could buy things using one of about 8,000 forms of money circulating in the country.

      <title>What Kamala Harris' economic agenda might look like</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Last weekend we were all thrown for a loop when President Joe Biden dropped out of the presidential race and endorsed Kamala Harris for the nomination. Just like everyone else, we are trying to quickly wrap our heads around what it means now that Harris is almost certainly going to be the Democratic nominee for president. <br/><br/>We expect to see the Harris campaign come out with some official policy proposals in the coming weeks and months. But for now, all we've got are clues, little breadcrumbs that she has dropped throughout her career that might lead us to a rough idea of what economic policies she might support. <br/><br/>Today on the show, we're going to visit three key moments from Harris' political career that might give us an idea of how her economic agenda might look. First, the 2019 presidential primary debates, where she laid out her own economic policies. Next, a vote in her Senate years that shows where she might fall on future trade agreements. And finally, a fight with some of the country's biggest banks from her very first year as Attorney General of California. <br/><br/><em>This episode was hosted by Keith Romer and Nick Fountain.

      <description><![CDATA[In 2022, artist Stuart Semple opened up his laptop to find that all his designs had turned black overnight. All the colors, across files on Adobe products like Photoshop and Illustrator, were gone. Who had taken the colors away?

      <title>Summer School 2: The golden ages of labor and looms</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Who has the power? Workers or bosses? It changes through the ages, though it's usually the bosses. Today, we look at two key moments when the power of labor shifted, for better and worse, and we ask why then? What does history have to say about labor power right now? <br/><br/>We travel to Sicily, Italy in the year 1347, where the bubonic plague is about to strike. The horror known as the Black Death will remake European society in countless ways, but we'll focus on one silver lining: how economic conditions shifted for workers. <br/><br/>Then we head about 500 years into the future, to an English factory at the dawn of the Industrial Revolution, where textile workers take up arms against the machines taking their jobs and show how rapidly labor supply and demand can change. This is the famed tale of the Luddites, now a byword for knee jerk anti-technology, but the true story has nuance and a desperate but rational violent rebellion. <br/><br/><em>This series is hosted by Robert Smith and produced by Audrey Dilling.

      <title>Rooftop solar's dark side</title>
      <description><![CDATA[4.5 million households in the U.S. have solar panels on their homes. Most of those customers are happy with it - their electricity bills have just about disappeared, and it's great for the planet. But thousands and thousands of people are really disappointed with what they've been sold. Their panels are more expensive than they should be, and they say it is hard to get someone to come fix them when they break. <br/><br/>It turns out this sometimes crummy customer experience is no accident. It ties back to how big, national solar companies built their businesses in the first place. To entice people to install expensive solar panels, companies developed new financing models which cut upfront costs for customers. And they deployed lots and lots of salespeople to grow their businesses. But in the drive to get more households installing solar panels, consumer costs went up and the focus seemed to shift away from making sure those panels actually worked. All of this left some consumers feeling like they've been sold a lie.<br/><br/>On today's episode, we look into how the residential solar business model has turned some people sour on solar. And we'll try to figure out where the industry could go from here. <br/><br/><em>Help support Planet Money and hear our bonus episodes by subscribing to Planet Money+ </em><a href="http://n.pr/PM-digital"><em>in Apple Podcasts</em></a><em> or at </em><a href="https://n.pr/3HlREPz"><em>plus.npr.org/planetmoney</em></a><em>.</em><br/><br/>Learn more about sponsor message choices: <a href="https://podcastchoices.com/adchoices">podcastchoices.com/adchoices</a><br/><br/><a href="https://www.npr.org/about-npr/179878450/privacy-policy">NPR Privacy Policy</a>]]></description>

      <title>How flying got so bad (or did it?)</title>
      <description><![CDATA[We often hear that air travel is worse than it's ever been. Gone are the days when airplanes touted piano bars and meat carving stations — or even free meals. Instead we're crammed into tiny seats and fighting for overhead space. <br/><br/>How did we get here? Most of the inconveniences we think about when we fly can be traced back to the period of time just after the federal government deregulated the airlines. <br/><br/>When commercial air travel took off in the 1940s, the government regulated how many national airlines were allowed to exist, where they were allowed to fly, and how much they could charge for tickets. But the Airline Deregulation Act of 1978 swept all these restrictions aside – and stopped providing subsidies for the air carriers. Airlines had to compete on ticket prices. That competition led to a more bare-bones flying experience, but it also made air travel a lot more affordable. <br/><br/>In this episode, we trace the evolution of air travel over the past century to discover whether flying really is worse today — or if it's actually better than ever. We'll board a plane from the "golden age" of air travel, hear the history of one of the original budget airlines and meet feuding airline CEOs. Along the way, we'll see how economic forces have shaped the airline industry into what it is today, and what role we, as consumers, have played. <br/><br/><em>Help support Planet Money and hear our bonus episodes by subscribing to Planet Money+ </em><a href="http://n.pr/PM-digital"><em>in Apple Podcasts</em></a><em> or at </em><a href="https://n.pr/3HlREPz"><em>plus.npr.org/planetmoney</em></a><em>.</em><br/><br/>Learn more about sponsor message choices: <a href="https://podcastchoices.com/adchoices">podcastchoices.com/adchoices</a><br/><br/><a href="https://www.npr.org/about-npr/179878450/privacy-policy">NPR Privacy Policy</a>]]></description>

      <title>The two companies driving the modern economy</title>
      <description><![CDATA[At the core of most of the electronics we use today are some very tiny, very powerful chips. Semiconductor chips. And they are mighty: they help power our phones, laptops, and cars. They enable advances in healthcare, military systems, transportation, and clean energy. And they're also critical for artificial intelligence, providing the hardware needed to train complex machine learning.<br/><br/>On today's episode, we're bringing you two stories from our daily show <em>The Indicator</em>, diving into the two most important semiconductor chip companies, which have transformed the industry over the past 40 years. <br/><br/>First, we trace NVIDIA's journey from making niche graphics cards for gaming to making the most advanced chips in the world — and briefly becoming the world's biggest company. Next, we see how the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company's decision to manufacture chips for its competition instead of itself flipped the entire industry on its head, and moved the vast majority of the world's advanced chip production to Taiwan. <br/><br/><em>Help support Planet Money and hear our bonus episode about NVIDIA by subscribing to Planet Money+ in </em><a href="http://n.pr/PM-digital"><em>Apple Podcasts</em></a><em> or at </em><a href="https://n.pr/3HlREPz"><em>plus.npr.org/planetmoney</em></a><em>. </em><br/><br/>Learn more about sponsor message choices: <a href="https://podcastchoices.com/adchoices">podcastchoices.com/adchoices</a><br/><br/><a href="https://www.npr.org/about-npr/179878450/privacy-policy">NPR Privacy Policy</a>]]></description>

      <title>Do immigrants really take jobs and lower wages?</title>
      <description><![CDATA[We wade into the heated debate over immigrants' impact on the labor market. When the number of workers in a city increases, does that take away jobs from the people who already live and work there? Does a surge of immigration hurt their wages? <br/><br/>The debate within the field of economics often centers on Nobel-prize winner David Card's ground-breaking paper, "The Impact of the Mariel Boatlift on the Miami Labor Market." Today on the show: the fight over that paper, and what it tells us about the debate over immigration. <br/><br/>More Listening:<br> - <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/money/2017/02/22/516691582/episode-654-when-the-boats-arrive">When The Boats Arrive</a><br> - <a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/01/18/1149875059/the-men-on-the-roof">The Men on the Roof</a><br/><br/><em>This episode was hosted by Amanda Aronczyk and Jeff Guo.

      <description><![CDATA[When the vape brand Juul first hit the market back in 2015, e-cigarettes were in a kind of regulatory limbo. At the time, the rules that governed tobacco cigarettes did not explicitly apply to e-cigarettes. Then Juul blew up, fueled a public health crisis over teen vaping, and inspired a regulatory crackdown. But when the government finally stepped in to solve the problem of youth vaping, it may have actually made things worse.<br/><br/>Today's episode is a collaboration with the new podcast series "Backfired: the Vaping Wars."

      <title>Why is everyone talking about Musk's money?</title>
      <description><![CDATA[We've lived amongst Elon Musk headlines for so long now that it's easy to forget just how much he sounds like a sci-fi character. He runs a space company and wants to colonize mars. He also runs a company that just implanted a computer chip into a human brain. And he believes there's a pretty high probability everything is a simulation and we are living inside of it.<br/><br/>But the latest Elon Musk headline-grabbing drama is less something out of sci-fi, and more something pulled from HBO's "Succession."<br/><br/>Elon Musk helped take Tesla from the brink of bankruptcy to one of the biggest companies in the world. And his compensation for that was an unprecedentedly large pay package that turned him into the richest person on Earth. But a judge made a decision about that pay package that set off a chain of events resulting in quite possibly the most expensive, highest stakes vote in publicly traded company history.<br/><br/>The ensuing battle over Musk's compensation is not just another wild Elon tale. It's a lesson in how to motivate the people running the biggest companies that – like it or not – are shaping our world. It's a classic economics problem with a very 2024 twist.<br/><br/><em>Help support Planet Money and hear our bonus episodes by subscribing to Planet Money+ </em><a href="http://n.pr/PM-digital"><em>in Apple Podcasts</em></a><em> or at </em><a href="https://n.pr/3HlREPz"><em>plus.npr.org/planetmoney</em></a><em>.</em><br/><br/>Learn more about sponsor message choices: <a href="https://podcastchoices.com/adchoices">podcastchoices.com/adchoices</a><br/><br/><a href="https://www.npr.org/about-npr/179878450/privacy-policy">NPR Privacy Policy</a>]]></description>

      <title>What's with all the tiny soda cans? And other grocery store mysteries, solved.</title>
      <description><![CDATA[There's a behind the scenes industry that helps big brands decide questions like: How big should a bag of chips be? What's the right size for a bottle of shampoo? And yes, also: When should a company do a little shrinkflation? <br/><br/>From <a href="https://x.com/MeCookieMonster/status/1764692032914690276">Cookie Monster</a> to President Biden, everybody is complaining about shrinkflation these days. But when we asked the packaging and pricing experts, they told us that shrinkflation is just one move in a much larger, much weirder 4-D chess game. <br/><br/>The name of that game is "price pack architecture." This is the idea that you shouldn't just sell your product in one or two sizes. You should sell your product in a whole range of different sizes, at a whole range of different price points. Over the past 15 years, price pack architecture has completely changed how products are marketed and sold in the United States. <br/><br/>Today, we are going on a shopping cart ride-along with one of those price pack architects. She's going to pull back the curtain and show us why some products are getting larger while others are getting smaller, and tell us about the adorable little soda can that started it all.<br/><br/>By the end of the episode, you'll never look at a grocery store the same way again. <br/><br/><em>Help support </em>Planet Money<em> and hear our bonus episodes by subscribing to </em>Planet Money<em>+ </em><a href="http://n.pr/PM-digital"><em>in Apple Podcasts</em></a><em> or at </em><a href="https://n.pr/3HlREPz"><em>plus.npr.org/planetmoney</em></a><em>.</em><br/><br/>Learn more about sponsor message choices: <a href="https://podcastchoices.com/adchoices">podcastchoices.com/adchoices</a><br/><br/><a href="https://www.npr.org/about-npr/179878450/privacy-policy">NPR Privacy Policy</a>]]></description>

      <title>Bringing a tariff to a graphite fight</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Graphite is sort of the one-hit wonder of minerals. And that hit? Pencils. Everyone loves to talk about pencils when it comes to graphite. If graphite were to perform a concert, they'd close out the show with "pencils," and everyone would clap and cheer. But true fans of graphite would be shouting out "batteries!" Because graphite is a key ingredient in another important thing that we all use in our everyday lives: lithium ion batteries.<br/><br/>Almost all of the battery-ready graphite in the world comes from one place: China. That's actually true of lots of the materials that go into batteries, like processed lithium and processed cobalt. Which is why it was such a big deal when, earlier this year, <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2024/05/14/remarks-by-president-biden-remarks-by-president-biden-on-his-actions-to-protect-american-workers-and-businesses-from-chinas-unfair-trade-practices/">President Biden announced a tariff package</a> that will make a bunch of Chinese imports more expensive. Included in this package are some tariffs on Chinese graphite. He wants to create a new battery future—one that doesn't rely so much on China. <br/><br/>In this episode, we get down on the ground to look at this big supply chain story through the lens of one critical mineral. And we visit a small town that realizes that it might be the perfect place to create an American graphite industry. And we find that declaring a new battery future is one thing, but making it happen is another thing entirely. <br><em><br>Help support </em>Planet Money<em> and hear our bonus episodes by subscribing to </em>Planet Money<em>+ </em><a href="http://n.pr/PM-digital"><em>in Apple Podcasts</em></a><em> or at </em><a href="https://n.pr/3HlREPz"><em>plus.npr.org/planetmoney</em></a><em>.</em><br/><br/>Learn more about sponsor message choices: <a href="https://podcastchoices.com/adchoices">podcastchoices.com/adchoices</a><br/><br/><a href="https://www.npr.org/about-npr/179878450/privacy-policy">NPR Privacy Policy</a>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Most economic textbooks will tell you that there can be real dangers in running up a big national debt. A major concern is how the debt you add now could slow down economic growth in the future. Economists have not been able to nail down how much debt a country can safely take on. But they have tried.<br/><br/>Back in 2010, two economists took a look at 20 countries over the course of decades, and sometimes centuries, and came back with a number. Their analysis suggested that economic growth slowed significantly once national debt passed 90% of annual GDP... and that is when the fight over debt and growth really took off.<br/><br/>On today's episode: a deep dive on what we know, and what we don't know, about when exactly national debt becomes a problem.

      <title>The history of light (classic)</title>
      <description><![CDATA[For thousands of years, getting light was a huge hassle. You had to make candles from scratch. This is not as romantic as it sounds. You had to get a cow, raise the cow, feed the cow, kill the cow, get the fat out of the cow, cook the fat, dip wicks into the fat. All that--for not very much light. Now, if we want to light a whole room, we just flip a switch.<br/><br/>The history of light explains why the world today is the way it is. It explains why we aren't all subsistence farmers, and why we can afford to have artists and massage therapists and plumbers. (And, yes, people who make podcasts about the history of light.) The history of light is the history of economic growth--of things getting faster, cheaper, and more efficient.<br/><br/>On today's show: How we got from dim little candles made out of cow fat, to as much light as we want at the flick of a switch.<br/><br/><em>Today's show was hosted by Jacob Goldstein and David Kestenbaum.

      <title>How the FBI's fake cell phone company put criminals into real jail cells</title>
      <description><![CDATA[There is a constant arms race between law enforcement and criminals, especially when it comes to technology. For years, law enforcement has been frustrated with encrypted messaging apps, like Signal and Telegram. And law enforcement has been even more frustrated by encrypted phones, specifically designed to thwart authorities from snooping. <br/><br/>But in 2018, in a story that seems like it's straight out of a spy novel, the FBI was approached with an offer: Would they like to get into the encrypted cell phone business? What if they could convince criminals to use their phones to plan and document their crimes — all while the FBI was secretly watching? It could be an unprecedented peek into the criminal underground. <br/><br/>To pull off this massive sting operation, the FBI needed to design a cell phone that criminals wanted to use and adopt. Their mission: to make a tech platform for the criminal underworld. And in many ways, the FBI's journey was filled with all the hallmarks of many Silicon Valley start-ups. <br/><br/>On this show, we talk with journalist <a href="https://www.404media.co/author/joseph-cox/">Joseph Cox</a>, who wrote a new book about the FBI's cell phone business, called <a href="https://www.publicaffairsbooks.com/titles/joseph-cox/dark-wire/9781541702691/"><em>Dark Wire</em></a>. And we hear from the federal prosecutor who became an unlikely tech company founder. <br><em><br>Help support Planet Money and hear our bonus episodes by subscribing to Planet Money+ </em><a href="http://n.pr/PM-digital"><em>in Apple Podcasts</em></a><em> or at </em><a href="https://n.pr/3HlREPz"><em>plus.npr.org/planetmoney</em></a><em>.</em><br/><br/>Learn more about sponsor message choices: <a href="https://podcastchoices.com/adchoices">podcastchoices.com/adchoices</a><br/><br/><a href="https://www.npr.org/about-npr/179878450/privacy-policy">NPR Privacy Policy</a>]]></description>

It could be an unprecedented peek into the criminal underground. <br/><br/>To pull off this massive sting operation, the FBI needed to design a cell phone that criminals wanted to use and adopt. Their mission: to make a tech platform for the criminal underworld. And in many ways, the FBI's journey was filled with all the hallmarks of many Silicon Valley start-ups. <br/><br/>On this show, we talk with journalist <a href="https://www.404media.co/author/joseph-cox/">Joseph Cox</a>, who wrote a new book about the FBI's cell phone business, called <a href="https://www.publicaffairsbooks.com/titles/joseph-cox/dark-wire/9781541702691/"><em>Dark Wire</em></a>. And we hear from the federal prosecutor who became an unlikely tech company founder. <br><em><br>Help support Planet Money and hear our bonus episodes by subscribing to Planet Money+ </em><a href="http://n.pr/PM-digital"><em>in Apple Podcasts</em></a><em> or at </em><a href="https://n.pr/3HlREPz"><em>plus.npr.org/planetmoney</em></a><em>.</em><br/><br/>Learn more about sponsor message choices: <a href="https://podcastchoices.com/adchoices">podcastchoices.com/adchoices</a><br/><br/><a href="https://www.npr.org/about-npr/179878450/privacy-policy">NPR Privacy Policy</a>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>So you've been scammed, now what?</title>
      <description><![CDATA[We are living in a kind of golden age for online fraudsters. As the number of apps and services for storing and sending money has exploded – so too have the schemes that bad actors have cooked up to steal that money. Every year, we hear more and more stories of financial heartbreak. What you don't often hear about is what happens <em>after </em>the scam?<br/><br/>On today's show, we follow one woman who was scammed out of over $800,000 on her quest to get her money back. That journey takes her from the halls of the FBI to the fraud departments of some of the country's biggest financial institutions. And it offers a window into how the systems that are theoretically designed to help the victims of financial cybercrime actually work in practice. <br/><br/><em>This episode was hosted by Alexi Horowitz-Ghazi and Jeff Guo.

      <title>The junkyard economist</title>
      <description><![CDATA[On today's episode, we ride through the streets of San Francisco with a long-time junkman, Jon Rolston. <br/><br/>Jon has spent the last two decades clearing out houses and offices of their junk. He's found all sorts of items: a life-time supply of toilet paper, gold rings, $20,000 in cash. Over the years, he's developed a keen eye for what has value and what might sell. He's become a kind of trash savant.<br/><br/>As we ride with Jon, he shows us the whole ecosystem of how our reusable trash gets dealt with — from metals (ferrous and non-ferrous) to tires to cardboard. And we see how our junk can sometimes get a second chance at life.  <br/><br/>If you can understand the junk market like Jon, you can understand dozens of trends in our economy. <br/><br/><em>This episode was hosted by Erika Beras and James Sneed, and produced by James Sneed with help from Emma Peaslee.

      <title>Anatomy of a layoff</title>
      <description><![CDATA[By one estimate, 40 percent of American workers get laid off at least once in their careers. And when that happens, companies will often say, "It's not personal. It has nothing to do with you or your performance. We're just changing priorities, making a strategic shift." <br/><br/>It's like the business version of: "It's not you, it's me." And just like a breakup, it feels terrible. <br/><br/>This happened to a man we're calling V, who was working at the same company as his husband when he got laid off. And for V, the experience felt shocking. It left him and his husband with a lot of unresolved questions. <br/><br/>On today's show, the story of that layoff. And we help that couple get some answers by taking their questions to an HR expert who gives the low-down on lay-offs. <br/><br/><em>This story is adapted from a 3-part series on layoffs produced by Yowei Shaw for her show, </em>Proxy<em>. The layoff series was edited by John DeLore with research and reporting help from Kim Nederveen Pieterse.

      <title>The hack that almost broke the internet</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Last month, the world narrowly avoided a cyberattack of stunning ambition. The targets were some of the most important computers on the planet. Computers that power the internet. Computers used by banks and airlines and even the military. <br/><br/>What these computers had in common was that they all relied on open source software. <br/><br/>A strange fact about modern life is that most of the computers responsible for it are running open source software. That is, software mostly written by unpaid, sometimes even anonymous volunteers. Some crucial open source programs are managed by just <a href="https://xkcd.com/2347/">a single overworked programmer</a>. And as the world learned last month, these programs can become attractive targets for hackers. <br/><br/>In this case, the hackers had infiltrated a popular open source program called XZ. Slowly, over the course of two years, they transformed XZ into a secret backdoor. And if they hadn't been caught, they could have taken control of large swaths of the internet. <br/><br/>On today's show, we get the story behind the XZ hack and what made it possible. How the hackers took advantage of the strange way we make modern software. And what that tells us about the economics of one of the most important industries in the world. <br><em><br>Help support Planet Money and hear our bonus episodes by subscribing to Planet Money+ </em><a href="http://n.pr/PM-digital"><em>in Apple Podcasts</em></a><em> or at </em><a href="https://n.pr/3HlREPz"><em>plus.npr.org/planetmoney</em></a><em>.</em><br/><br/>Learn more about sponsor message choices: <a href="https://podcastchoices.com/adchoices">podcastchoices.com/adchoices</a><br/><br/><a href="https://www.npr.org/about-npr/179878450/privacy-policy">NPR Privacy Policy</a>]]></description>

      <title>Why Gold? (Classic)</title>
      <description><![CDATA[In the past few months, the price of gold has gone way up – even hitting a new high last month at just over $2,400 per troy ounce. <br/><br/>Gold has long had a shiny quality to it, literally and in the marketplace. And we wondered, why is that? <br/><br/>Today on the show, we revisit a Planet Money classic episode: Why Gold?

      <title>Zombie mortgages are coming back to life</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Karen McDonough of Quincy, Mass., was enjoying her tea one morning in the dining room when she saw something odd outside her window: a group of people gathering on her lawn. A man with a clipboard told her that her home no longer belonged to her. It didn't matter that she'd been paying her mortgage for 17 years and was current on it. She was a nurse with a good job and had raised her kids there. But this was a foreclosure sale, and she was going to lose her house. <br/><br/>McDonough had fallen victim to what's called a zombie second mortgage. Homeowners think these loans are long dead. But then the loans come back to life because they get bought up, sometimes for pennies on the dollar, by debt collectors that then move to collect and foreclose on people's homes. <br/><br/>On today's episode: An NPR investigation reveals the practice to be widespread. Also, what are zombie mortgages? Is all this legal? And is there any way for homeowners to fight the zombies? <br/><br/>You can read more about zombie second mortgages online at: <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/05/10/1197959049/zombie-second-mortgages-homeowners-foreclosure">npr.org/zombie</a><br> <em><br>Correction: An earlier version of this episode description misspelled Karen McDonough's last name as MacDonough.<br/><br/>Help support </em>Planet Money<em> and get bonus episodes by subscribing to Planet Money+ in </em><a href="http://n.pr/PM-digital"><em>Apple Podcasts</em></a><em> or at </em><a href="https://n.pr/3HlREPz"><em>plus.npr.org/planetmoney</em></a><em>.</em><br/><br/>Learn more about sponsor message choices: <a href="https://podcastchoices.com/adchoices">podcastchoices.com/adchoices</a><br/><br/><a href="https://www.npr.org/about-npr/179878450/privacy-policy">NPR Privacy Policy</a>]]></description>

      <title>The case of the stolen masks</title>
      <description><![CDATA[About thirty years ago, Yagya Kumar Pradhan woke up to the news that the temple he and his clan used had been broken into. The temple had been ransacked. And someone had stolen two holy Bhairav masks. Yagya says they had been in his family for more than five hundred years – since the 16th century. <br/><br/>Yagya is a kind of Hindu priest for his clan. And he says, these Bhairav masks were very holy. People made offerings to them during Dashaun, a festival held in the fall. <br/><br/>Yagya thought the masks were gone for good. He didn't realize... they were hiding in plain sight. <br/><br/>On today's show: The story of a group of amateur art detectives who use modern tools, subterfuge, and the power of the law to return stolen artifacts to their rightful owners. And we dive into the world of high-end auctions and art museums to ask: Can the art world survive the legacy of cultural theft? <br/><br/><em>Clarification: This episode has been updated to clarify that the reason the Rubin Museum is shuttering its building is not directly linked to repatriation. </em><br/><br/><em>This episode was hosted by Erika Beras and Nick Fountain.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[About thirty years ago, Yagya Kumar Pradhan woke up to the news that the temple he and his clan used had been broken into. The temple had been ransacked. And someone had stolen two holy Bhairav masks. Yagya says they had been in his family for more than five hundred years – since the 16th century. <br/><br/>Yagya is a kind of Hindu priest for his clan. And he says, these Bhairav masks were very holy. People made offerings to them during Dashaun, a festival held in the fall. <br/><br/>Yagya thought the masks were gone for good. He didn't realize... they were hiding in plain sight. <br/><br/>On today's show: The story of a group of amateur art detectives who use modern tools, subterfuge, and the power of the law to return stolen artifacts to their rightful owners. And we dive into the world of high-end auctions and art museums to ask: Can the art world survive the legacy of cultural theft? <br/><br/><em>Clarification: This episode has been updated to clarify that the reason the Rubin Museum is shuttering its building is not directly linked to repatriation. </em><br/><br/><em>This episode was hosted by Erika Beras and Nick Fountain.

      <title>TikTok made me deduct it</title>
      <description><![CDATA[TikTok, and other apps like it, are filled with financial advice. Some of it is reliable, some... less so. <br/><br/>There are videos about running a business, having a side hustle, generating passive income. And also, there are a lot of tips and tricks, many of them questionable, about saving on your taxes. <br/><br/>On this show, we run some of the greatest hits of TikTok tax advice by some bonafide tax experts.  We'll talk about whether you can use gambling losses to reduce your tax bill, whether your pets qualify you for tax deductions – and we'll fact check the claim that all rich people own expensive Mercedes G-Wagons... for tax purposes. <br/><br/>Along the way, we'll drill down on the concepts like taxable income and the standard deduction. And we'll ask why so many videos on TikTok suggest that you (fraudulently) categorize personal expenses as business expenses. Sometimes with a literal wink and a nod. <br/><br/><em>This episode was hosted by Nick Fountain. It was produced by Emma Peaslee with help from Willa Rubin, who also fact-checked this episode.

He was at a fair where lots of people were guessing the weight of an ox, so he decided to take the average of all their guesses and compare it to the correct answer.<em><br/><br/></em>What he found shocked him. The average of their guesses was almost exactly accurate. The crowd was off by just one pound.<em><br/><br/></em>This eerie phenomenon—this idea that the crowd is right—drives everything from the stock market to the price of orange juice.<em><br/><br/></em>So, we decided to test it for ourselves. We asked Planet Money listeners to guess the weight of a cow.<em><br/><br/></em>Spoiler: You can see the results <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/money/2015/08/07/429720443/17-205-people-guessed-the-weight-of-a-cow-heres-how-they-did">here</a>.<em><br/><br/>This episode was hosted by David Kestenbaum and Jacob Goldstein.

He was at a fair where lots of people were guessing the weight of an ox, so he decided to take the average of all their guesses and compare it to the correct answer.<em><br/><br/></em>What he found shocked him. The average of their guesses was almost exactly accurate. The crowd was off by just one pound.<em><br/><br/></em>This eerie phenomenon—this idea that the crowd is right—drives everything from the stock market to the price of orange juice.<em><br/><br/></em>So, we decided to test it for ourselves. We asked Planet Money listeners to guess the weight of a cow.<em><br/><br/></em>Spoiler: You can see the results <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/money/2015/08/07/429720443/17-205-people-guessed-the-weight-of-a-cow-heres-how-they-did">here</a>.<em><br/><br/>This episode was hosted by David Kestenbaum and Jacob Goldstein.

      <title>Japan's Lost Decades</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Last month, Japan's central bank raised interest rates for the first time in 17 years. That is a really big deal, because it means that one of the spookiest stories in modern economics might finally have an ending. <br/><br/>Back in the 1980s, Japan performed something of an economic miracle. It transformed itself into the number two economy in the world. From Walkmans to Toyotas, the U.S. was awash in Japanese imports. And Japanese companies went on a spending spree. Sony bought up Columbia Pictures. Mitsubishi became the new majority owners of Rockefeller Center. <br/><br/>But in the early 1990s, it all came to a sudden halt. Japan went from being one of the fastest growing countries in the world to one of the slowest. And this economic stagnation went on and on and on. For decades. <br/><br/>On this episode, the unnerving story of Japan's Lost Decades: How did one of the most advanced economies in the world just fall down one day — and not be able to get up? Japan's predicament changed our understanding of what can go wrong in a modern economy. And gave us some new tools to try and deal with it. <br/><br/><em>This episode was hosted by Jeff Guo.

      <title>The real estate industry on trial</title>
      <description><![CDATA[In 2019, Mike Ketchmark got a call. Mike is a lawyer in Kansas City, Missouri, and his friend, Brandon Boulware, another lawyer, was calling about a case he wanted Mike to get involved with. Mike was an unusual choice - he's a personal injury lawyer, and this was going to be an antitrust case. <br/><br/>But Brandon knew Mike was great in front of a jury. And that he'd won huge settlements for his clients in the past. <br/><br/>So the lawyer friend drops by Mike's office, and pitches him the case. Rhonda and Scott Burnett had just sold their home for $250,000, and out of that amount, they had paid $15,000 in commission (plus a small fee), which was split between two real estate agents - even though they had hired only one. And the commission was high - 6%. Mike's friend said the whole thing seemed... suspicious. Maybe even illegal. <br/><br/>Mike agreed to take the case, a case that would soon become bigger than one about just what had happened to the Burnetts. It would become a fight about the way homes are bought and sold in the U.S. and challenge the way real estate agents have done business for more than 100 years. <br/><br/><em>This episode was hosted by Amanda Aronczyk and Keith Romer.

      <title>How much of your tax dollars are going to Israel and Ukraine</title>
      <description><![CDATA[There's been a lot of disagreement in Congress and in the country about whether the U.S. should continue to financially support the wars in Ukraine and Gaza. <br/><br/>Some taxpayers don't think the U.S. should give Ukraine any money to fight off Russia's invasion. And some taxpayers have concerns about how they might be funding weapons that have been used to kill civilians in Gaza. And there are questions about how much individual taxpayers contribute to war efforts, generally. <br/><br/>So in this episode, we attempt to do the math: The average taxpayers' contribution to Israel and Ukraine. It's not so simple. But in attempting to do this math, we get this window into the role of our tax dollars on foreign assistance, and how the U.S. sells weapons to other countries. <br/><br/>For links to some of the reports we looked at to report this episode, check out the <a href="http://npr.org/2024/03/29/1197958571/us-military-aid-tax-ukraine-israel-gaza-russia">episode page</a> on NPR.org.<br/><br/><em>This episode was hosted by Sarah Gonzalez and Alexi Horowitz-Ghazi.

      <title>What is Temu?</title>
      <description><![CDATA[It is rare that a new e-commerce company has such a meteoric rise as Temu. The company, which launched in the fall of 2022, has been flooding the American advertising market, buying much of the inventory of Facebook, Snapchat, and beyond. According to the market intelligence firm Sensor Tower, Temu is one of the most downloaded iPhone apps in the country, with around 50 million monthly active users.<br/><br/>On today's show, we go deep on Temu: How does it work, how did it manage such a quick rise in the U.S., and what hints might it offer us about the future of retail? Plus, we'll talk to the bicycle-loving U.S. Representative who is working to shut down a loophole that has proved very helpful to Temu's swift ascent. <br/><br/><em>This episode was hosted by Nick Fountain and Alexi Horowitz-Ghazi with reporting from Emily Feng.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[It is rare that a new e-commerce company has such a meteoric rise as Temu. The company, which launched in the fall of 2022, has been flooding the American advertising market, buying much of the inventory of Facebook, Snapchat, and beyond. According to the market intelligence firm Sensor Tower, Temu is one of the most downloaded iPhone apps in the country, with around 50 million monthly active users.<br/><br/>On today's show, we go deep on Temu: How does it work, how did it manage such a quick rise in the U.S., and what hints might it offer us about the future of retail? Plus, we'll talk to the bicycle-loving U.S. Representative who is working to shut down a loophole that has proved very helpful to Temu's swift ascent. <br/><br/><em>This episode was hosted by Nick Fountain and Alexi Horowitz-Ghazi with reporting from Emily Feng.

      <title>The billion dollar war behind U.S. rum</title>
      <description><![CDATA[When you buy a bottle of rum in the United States, by law nearly all the federal taxes on that rum must be sent to Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. It's an unusual system that Congress designed decades ago to help fund these two U.S. territories. In 2021 alone, these rum tax payments added up to more than $700 million.<br/><br/>Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands split the money according to how much rum each territory produces. And the territories produce a lot of it — especially Puerto Rico, which single handedly supplies the majority of the rum that Americans drink.<br/><br/>But in 2008, the U.S. Virgin Islands pulled off a coup. It convinced one of the largest rum brands in the world, Captain Morgan, to abandon Puerto Rico and to shift its operations to the tiny island of St. Croix.<br/><br/>This was the beginning of the Rum Wars.<br/><br/>On today's show, the story of how a scheme designed to help Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands turned them into bitter rivals. And how it ended up putting hundreds of millions of dollars a year — U.S. taxpayer dollars — into the pockets of big liquor companies instead.<br/><br/><em>This episode was hosted by Jeff Guo and Sarah Gonzalez.

      <title>Wind boom, wind bust (Two Windicators)</title>
      <description><![CDATA[The wind power business is a bit contradictory right now. It's showing signs of boom and bust seemingly all at once. <br/><br/>The story of wind energy markets in two acts today. First, the Gulf of Mexico saw its first-ever auction of leases for offshore wind this summer. It was another sign of the Biden administration's desire to get more renewable energy online as fast as possible. Expectations were high, but results did not deliver. Two of the three patches of sea didn't get any bids at all. Hidden in the flop for this auction are some keys to what it takes to spark a whole new market, quickly. <br/><br/>Then, the booming side of wind power: the job that's projected to be the fastest-growing in the U.S. is wind turbine service technician. Is it a "good" job?

      <description><![CDATA[When you sit down to watch the Oscars, what you are really watching is the final battle in a months-long war of financial engineering and campaign strategy. Because in Hollywood, every year is an election year. A small army of Oscars campaign strategists help studios and streamers deploy tens of millions of dollars to sway Academy voters.

      <title>Is dynamic pricing coming to a supermarket near you?</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Dynamic pricing is an increasingly common phenomenon: You can see it when <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/surge-pricing-emergency-gouging-1.6670186">Uber prices surge during rainy weather</a>, or when <a href="https://insights.som.yale.edu/insights/is-dynamic-airline-pricing-costing-us">you're booking a flight at the last minute</a> or <a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/168988/taylor-swift-ticketmaster-dynamic-pricing">buying tickets to your favorite superstar's concert</a>. On an earnings call last week, Wendy's ignited a minor controversy by suggesting it would introduce dynamic pricing in its restaurants, but the company quickly <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/02/28/1234412431/wendys-dynamic-surge-pricing">clarified that it wasn't planning on using it for "surge pricing</a>."<br/><br/>One place you hardly ever see dynamic pricing? American supermarkets. <br/><br/>Why is that? Why shouldn't the prices for meat or bread or produce go down as they get older? Why does all the milk in the store cost the same, even when the "sell by" dates are weeks apart? Wouldn't a little more flexibility around prices be better for customers and help reduce waste?<br/><br/>Professors Robert Evan Sanders and Ioannis (Yannis) Stamatopoulus had similar questions. So they set out to discover what was keeping supermarkets from employing a more dynamic approach, and what might convince them it was time for a change ... in pricing.<br/><br/><em>This episode was hosted by Amanda Aronczyk and Nick Fountain.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[Dynamic pricing is an increasingly common phenomenon: You can see it when <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/surge-pricing-emergency-gouging-1.6670186">Uber prices surge during rainy weather</a>, or when <a href="https://insights.som.yale.edu/insights/is-dynamic-airline-pricing-costing-us">you're booking a flight at the last minute</a> or <a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/168988/taylor-swift-ticketmaster-dynamic-pricing">buying tickets to your favorite superstar's concert</a>. On an earnings call last week, Wendy's ignited a minor controversy by suggesting it would introduce dynamic pricing in its restaurants, but the company quickly <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/02/28/1234412431/wendys-dynamic-surge-pricing">clarified that it wasn't planning on using it for "surge pricing</a>."<br/><br/>One place you hardly ever see dynamic pricing? American supermarkets. <br/><br/>Why is that? Why shouldn't the prices for meat or bread or produce go down as they get older? Why does all the milk in the store cost the same, even when the "sell by" dates are weeks apart? Wouldn't a little more flexibility around prices be better for customers and help reduce waste?<br/><br/>Professors Robert Evan Sanders and Ioannis (Yannis) Stamatopoulus had similar questions. So they set out to discover what was keeping supermarkets from employing a more dynamic approach, and what might convince them it was time for a change ... in pricing.<br/><br/><em>This episode was hosted by Amanda Aronczyk and Nick Fountain.

      <title>Shopping for parental benefits around the world</title>
      <description><![CDATA[It is so expensive to have a kid in the United States. The U.S. is one of just a handful of countries worldwide with no federal paid parental leave; it offers functionally no public childcare (and private childcare is wildly expensive); and women can expect their pay to take a hit after becoming a parent. (Incidentally, men's wages tend to rise after becoming fathers.) <br/><br/>But outside the U.S., many countries desperately want kids to be born inside their borders. One reason? Many countries are facing a looming problem in their population demographics: they have a ton of aging workers, fewer working-age people paying taxes, and not enough new babies being born to become future workers and taxpayers. And some countries are throwing money at the problem, offering parents generous benefits, even including straight-up cash for kids. <br/><br/>So if the U.S. makes it very hard to have kids, but other countries are willing to pay you for having them....maybe you can see the opportunity here. Very economic, and very pregnant, host Mary Childs did. Which is why she went benefits shopping around the world. Between Sweden, Singapore, South Korea, Estonia, and Canada, who will offer her the best deal for her pregnancy?<br/><br/><em>Help support Planet Money and get bonus episodes by subscribing to Planet Money+ </em><a href="http://n.pr/PM-digital"><em>in Apple Podcasts</em></a><em> or at </em><a href="https://n.pr/3HlREPz"><em>plus.npr.org/planetmoney</em></a><em>.</em><br/><br/>Learn more about sponsor message choices: <a href="https://podcastchoices.com/adchoices">podcastchoices.com/adchoices</a><br/><br/><a href="https://www.npr.org/about-npr/179878450/privacy-policy">NPR Privacy Policy</a>]]></description>

      <title>The secret world behind school fundraisers</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Fundraising is a staple of the school experience in the U.S. There's an assembly showing off all the prizes kids can win by selling enough wrapping paper or chocolate to their neighbors. But it's pretty weird, right?<br/><br/>Why do schools turn kids into little salespeople? And why do we let companies come in and dangle prizes in front of students?<br/><br/>We spend a year with one elementary school, following their fundraising efforts, to see how much they raise, and what the money goes to. <br/><br/>The school – Villacorta Elementary in La Puente, California – has one big goal: To raise enough money to send every single student on one field trip.

      <title>A controversial idea at the heart of Bidenomics</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Réka Juhász is a professor of economics at the University of British Columbia, and she studies what's known as industrial policy. <br/><br/>That's the general term for whenever the government tries to promote specific sectors of the economy. The idea is that they might be able to supercharge growth by giving money to certain kinds of businesses, or by putting up trade barriers to protect certain industries. Economists have long been against it. Industrial policy has been called a "taboo" subject, and "one of the most toxic phrases" in economics. The mainstream view has been that industrial policy is inefficient, even harmful. <br/><br/>For a long time, politicians largely accepted that view. But in the past several years, countries have started to embrace industrial policy—most notably in the United States. Under President Biden, the U.S. is set to spend hundreds of billions of dollars on industrial policy, to fund things like microchip manufacturing and clean energy projects. It's one of the most ambitious tests of industrial policy in U.S. history. And the billion dollar question is ... will it work? <br/><br/>On today's show, Réka takes us on a fun, nerdy journey to explain the theory behind industrial policy, why it's so controversial, and where President Biden's big experiment might be headed.<br/><br/><em>Help support Planet Money and get bonus episodes by subscribing to Planet Money+ </em><a href="http://n.pr/PM-digital"><em>in Apple Podcasts</em></a><em> or at </em><a href="https://n.pr/3HlREPz"><em>plus.npr.org/planetmoney</em></a><em>.</em><br/><br/>Learn more about sponsor message choices: <a href="https://podcastchoices.com/adchoices">podcastchoices.com/adchoices</a><br/><br/><a href="https://www.npr.org/about-npr/179878450/privacy-policy">NPR Privacy Policy</a>]]></description>

      <title>How the Navy came to protect cargo ships</title>
      <description><![CDATA[The <em>Genco Picardy</em> is not an American ship. It doesn't pay U.S. taxes, none of its crew are U.S. nationals, and when it sailed through the Red Sea last month, it wasn't carrying cargo to or from an American port. <br/><br/>But when the Houthis, a tribal militant group from Yemen, attacked the ship, the crew called the U.S. Navy. That same day, the Navy fired missiles at Houthi sites.<br/><br/>On today's show: How did protecting the safe passage of other countries' ships in the Red Sea become a job for the U.S. military?  It goes back to an idea called Freedom of the Seas, an idea that started out as an abstract pipe dream when it was coined in the early 1600s – but has become a pillar of the global economy.  <br/><br/><em>This episode was hosted by Alex Mayyasi and Nick Fountain.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[The <em>Genco Picardy</em> is not an American ship. It doesn't pay U.S. taxes, none of its crew are U.S. nationals, and when it sailed through the Red Sea last month, it wasn't carrying cargo to or from an American port. <br/><br/>But when the Houthis, a tribal militant group from Yemen, attacked the ship, the crew called the U.S. Navy. That same day, the Navy fired missiles at Houthi sites.<br/><br/>On today's show: How did protecting the safe passage of other countries' ships in the Red Sea become a job for the U.S. military?  It goes back to an idea called Freedom of the Seas, an idea that started out as an abstract pipe dream when it was coined in the early 1600s – but has become a pillar of the global economy.  <br/><br/><em>This episode was hosted by Alex Mayyasi and Nick Fountain.

      <title>A lawsuit for your broken heart</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Keith King was upset when his marriage ended. His wife had cheated, and his family broke apart. And that's when he learned about a very old type of lawsuit, called a heart balm tort.

And also, what happened when Keith King used a heart balm tort to try to deal with the most significant economic entanglement of his life: his marriage.<br/><br/><em>This episode was hosted by Erika Beras and Sarah Gonzalez.

      <title>Morally questionable, economically efficient</title>
      <description><![CDATA[There are tons of markets that don't exist because people just don't want to <em>allow</em> a market – for whatever reason, people feel icky about putting a price on something. For example: Surrogacy is a legal industry in parts of the United States, but not in much of the rest of the world. Assisted end-of-life is a legal medical transaction in some states, but is illegal in others.<br/><br/>When we have those knee-jerk reactions and our gut repels us from considering something apparently icky, economics asks us to look a little more closely. <br/><br/>Today on the show, we have three recommendations of things that may feel kinda wrong but economics suggests may actually be the better way. First: Could the matching process of organ donation be more efficient if people could buy and sell organs? Then: Should women seek revenge more often in the workplace? And finally, what if insider trading is actually useful? <br/><br/><em>This episode was hosted by Mary Childs and Greg Rosalsky. It was produced by Willa Rubin and edited by Jess Jiang.

      <title>Rescues at sea, and how to make a fortune</title>
      <description><![CDATA[At around 1 a.m. on the morning of November 15, 1994, Captain Prentice "Skip" Strong III woke to a distress call. Skip was the new captain of an oil tanker called the <em>Cherry Valley</em>. He and his crew had been making their way up the coast of Florida that evening when a tropical storm had descended. It had been a rough night of 15 foot waves and 50 mile per hour winds.<br/><br/>The distress call was coming from a tugboat whose engines were failing in the storm. Now adrift, the tugboat was on a dangerous collision course with the shore. The only ship close enough to mount a rescue was the <em>Cherry Valley.</em> <br/><br/>Skip faced a difficult decision. A fully loaded, 688-foot oil tanker is hardly anyone's first choice of a rescue vessel. It is as maneuverable as a school bus on ice. And the <em>Cherry Valley </em>was carrying ten million gallons of heavy fuel oil. A rescue attempt would put them in dangerously shallow water. One wrong move, and they would have an ecological disaster on the order of the <em>Exxon Valdez</em>. <br/><br/>What happened next that night would be dissected and debated for years to come. The actions of Skip and his crew would lead to a surprising discovery, a record-setting lawsuit, and one of the strangest legal battles in maritime history. At the center of it all, an impossible question: How do you put a price tag on doing the right thing?<br><em><br>Help support Planet Money and get bonus episodes by subscribing to Planet Money+ </em><a href="http://n.pr/PM-digital"><em>in Apple Podcasts</em></a><em> or at </em><a href="https://n.pr/3HlREPz"><em>plus.npr.org/planetmoney</em></a><em>.</em><br/><br/>Learn more about sponsor message choices: <a href="https://podcastchoices.com/adchoices">podcastchoices.com/adchoices</a><br/><br/><a href="https://www.npr.org/about-npr/179878450/privacy-policy">NPR Privacy Policy</a>]]></description>

      <title>Mid-East conflict escalation, two indicators</title>
      <description><![CDATA[On today's show, we look at <a href="https://www.npr.org/podcasts/510325/the-indicator-from-planet-money">two indicators</a> of the economic disruptions of the war in Gaza and try to trace how far they will reach. <br/><br/>We start in the Red Sea, a crucial link in the global supply chain connecting to the Suez Canal, with around 15% of the world's shipping passing through it. This includes oil tankers and massive container ships transporting everything from microchips to furniture. With Houthi rebels attacking container ships in solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza, shipping lines are re-routing, adding time and cost to delivery. We look at how ocean shipping is a web more than a chain of links, and try to see which parts of the web can take up more strain as the Red Sea and the Suez Canal become too dangerous to pass. <br/><br/>Then, we'll consider what escalation could mean for the region's most important export: oil. Five steps of escalation each mean a ratcheting up of costs that knock on to other industries, like food. Some prices are likely to rise faster than others, though. <br/><br/>Help support Planet Money and get bonus episodes by subscribing to Planet Money+ in <a href="http://n.pr/PM-digital">Apple Podcasts</a> or at <a href="https://n.pr/3HlREPz">plus.npr.org/planetmoney</a>.<br/><br/>Learn more about sponsor message choices: <a href="https://podcastchoices.com/adchoices">podcastchoices.com/adchoices</a><br/><br/><a href="https://www.npr.org/about-npr/179878450/privacy-policy">NPR Privacy Policy</a>]]></description>

      <title>The Maine Potato War of 1976</title>
      <description><![CDATA[When you think of a potato, one state probably comes to mind: Idaho. But for much of American history, Maine was home to the nation's largest potato crop. <br/><br/>That status had changed by the 1970s, with the West growing more and more of the nation's potatoes. But Maine still had one distinct advantage: A privileged position in the commodities market. The New York Mercantile Exchange, one of the largest such marketplaces in the country, exclusively dealt in Maine potatoes. And two deep-pocketed Western potato kingpins weren't happy about it. <br/><br/>So the Westerners waged what's now called the Maine Potato War of 1976. Their battlefield was the futures market: A special type of marketplace, made up of hordes of screaming traders, where potatoes can be bought and sold before they're even planted. <br/><br/>The Westerners did something so bold – and so unexpected – that it brought not only the potato market, but the entire New York commodities exchange, to its knees. <br/><br/>Today on the show, how a war waged through futures contracts influenced the kind of potatoes we eat. <br/><br/><em>This episode was hosted by Dylan Sloan and Nick Fountain.

      <title>The Universal Basic Income experiment in Kenya</title>
      <description><![CDATA[There's this fundamental question in economics that has proven really hard to answer: What's a good way to help people out of poverty? The old-school way was to fund programs that would support very particular things, like buying cows for a village, giving people business training, or building schools.<br/><br/>But over the past few decades, there has been a new idea: Could you help people who don't have money by ... just giving them money? We covered this question in a segment of <em>This American Life</em> that originally ran in <a href="https://www.thisamericanlife.org/503/i-was-just-trying-to-help/act-one-1">2013</a>. <a href="https://academic.oup.com/qje/article-abstract/131/4/1973/2468874">Economists who studied the question found</a> that giving people cash had positive effects on recipients' economic and psychological well-being. Maybe they bought a cow that could earn them money each week. Maybe they could replace their grass roofs with metal roofs that didn't need fixing every so often. <br/><br/>The success of just giving people in poverty cash has spawned a whole set of new questions that economists are now trying to answer. Like, if we do just give money, what's the best way to do that? Do you just give it all at once? Or do you dole it out over time?

The contenders: the possible soft landing, consumer sentiment, and the housing market.<br/><br/>And looking ahead to 2024, what will the economic indicator of next year be? Interest rates, Bidenomics, or junk fees?<br/><br/>Listen to our hosts make their case, and then tell us who won by submitting your vote via<a href="https://www.instagram.com/planetmoney"> Planet Money's Instagram</a> or email us with "Family Feud" in the subject line.

      <title>We buy a lot of Christmas trees (Update)</title>
      <description><![CDATA[*Note: This episode originally ran in 2020*<br/><br/>'Tis the season for Americans to head out in droves and bring home a freshly-cut Christmas tree. But decorative evergreens don't just magically show up on corner lots, waiting to find a home in your living room. There are a bunch of fascinating steps that determine exactly how many Christmas trees get sold, and how expensive they are.<br/><br/>Today on the show, we visit the world's largest auction of Christmas trees — and then see how much green New Yorkers are willing to throw down for some greenery. It's a story where snow-dusted Yuletide dreams meet the hard reality of supply and demand.

      <title>Dollarizing Argentina</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Argentina has been on a decades-long search for economic stability, but it always seems to be out of reach. High inflation has been plaguing the country and just surpassed 160% a year.<br/><br/>Over the past couple of years, the local currency has collapsed. One U.S. dollar used to be worth 20 Argentinean pesos in 2018. Today, one U.S. dollar is worth 1,000 pesos on the black market. And that means for Argentineans, the real prices of everything — from groceries to gas — have spiked.<br/><br/>In a country where the local currency is in free fall, promising to replace that currency with the US dollar can seem like a magical solution.<br/><br/>Argentina's new president, Javier Milei, won in part by promising to do just that - to <em>dollarize</em>. To scrap Argentina's peso and replace it with the relatively stable, predictable, boring United States dollar.<br/><br/>On today's show, what does dollarizing mean? Why dollarize, how to do it, and will it even work?<br/><br/>For more:<br>A black market, a currency crisis, and a tango competition in Argentina (<a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/a-black-market-a-currency-crisis-and-a/id290783428?i=1000628885498">Apple</a>, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7e837t8sXAepm1uHL508mJ?si=959641c44035450f">Spotify</a>, <a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/09/22/1197954122/argentina-peso-inflation-milei">NPR</a>)<br><a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/money/2018/08/03/635521893/episode-858-venezuelas-fugitive-money-traders">Venezuela's Fugitive Money Traders<br></a><a href="https://www.npr.org/2018/11/01/663121186/why-ecuador-uses-the-dollar">Why Ecuador Uses The Dollar? : The Indicator from Planet Money<br></a><em><br>Help support Planet Money and get bonus episodes by subscribing to Planet Money+ </em><a href="http://n.pr/PM-digital"><em>in Apple Podcasts</em></a><em> or at </em><a href="https://n.pr/3HlREPz"><em>plus.npr.org/planetmoney</em></a><em>.</em><br/><br/>Learn more about sponsor message choices: <a href="https://podcastchoices.com/adchoices">podcastchoices.com/adchoices</a><br/><br/><a href="https://www.npr.org/about-npr/179878450/privacy-policy">NPR Privacy Policy</a>]]></description>

The forum has become notorious <a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/05/03/720139562/episode-910-economics-sexism-data">for racist and sexist posts</a>, often attacking specific women and people from marginalized backgrounds.  <br/><br/>Last year, economist Florian Ederer and engineer Kyle Jensen discovered a flaw in the way the site gave anonymity to its users. The flaw made it possible to identify which universities and institutions were the sources of many of the toxic posts on the site.

      <title>Why '90s ads are unforgettable</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Maybe she's born with it, maybe it's __________.<br/><br/>The best part of waking up, is _______ in your cup!<br/><br/>Got ____?<br/><br/>If you can identify these brands based on tagline alone, it's possible you... are a 90s kid.<br/><br/>The '90s were arguably the peak moment of advertisers trying to make an impression on us that could last for decades. They got us to sing their jingles and say their slogans. These kinds of ads are called brand or image marketing. And it became a lot harder to pull off in the 21st century. <br/><br/>On today's show, we look back at the history of advertising, and two pretty unassuming products that totally transformed ads. <br/><br/><em>This show was hosted by Sarah Gonzalez and Kenny Malone.

They got us to sing their jingles and say their slogans. These kinds of ads are called brand or image marketing. And it became a lot harder to pull off in the 21st century. <br/><br/>On today's show, we look back at the history of advertising, and two pretty unassuming products that totally transformed ads. <br/><br/><em>This show was hosted by Sarah Gonzalez and Kenny Malone.

      <title>Why do doctors still use pagers?</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Remember pagers? They were huge in the 80s — these little devices that could receive short messages. Sir Mix-A-Lot even had a song about them! But then cell phones came along, and pagers more or less became obsolete.<br/><br/>Except there's one group of people who still carry pagers: medical doctors. At a surprisingly large number of hospitals, the pager remains the backbone of communication. Need to ask a doctor a question? Page them. Need to summon a doctor to an emergency? Page them. And then... wait for them to call you back.<br/><br/>Almost everyone agrees that pagers are a clunky and error-prone way for doctors to communicate. So why do so many hospitals still rely on them?On today's show: A story about two doctors who hatched a plan to finally rid their hospital of pagers. And the surprising lessons they learned about why some obsolete technologies can be so hard to replace.<br/><br/><em>This episode was hosted by Jeff Guo and Nick Fountain.

      <title>So you want to sell marijuana across state lines</title>
      <description><![CDATA[In the state of Oregon, there is a glut of grass. A wealth of weed. A crisis of chronic. <br/><br/>And, jokes aside, it's a real problem for people who work in the cannabis industry like Matt Ochoa. Ochoa runs the Jefferson Packing House in Medford, Oregon, which provides marijuana growers with services like drying, trimming and packing their product. He has seen literal tons of usable weed being left in marijuana fields all over the state of Oregon. Because, Ochoa says, there aren't enough buyers. <br/><br/>There are just over four million people in Oregon, and so far this year, farmers have grown 8.8 million pounds of weed. Which means there's nearly a pound of dried, smokable weed for every single person in the state of Oregon. As a result, the sales price for legal marijuana in the last couple of years has plummeted.<br/><br/>Economics has a straightforward solution for Oregon's overabundance problem: trade! But, Oregon's marijuana can only be sold in Oregon. No one in any state can legally sell weed across state lines, because marijuana is still illegal under federal law. On today's episode, how a product that is simultaneously legal and illegal can create some... sticky business problems. <br><em><br>Help support Planet Money and get bonus episodes by subscribing to Planet Money+ </em><a href="http://n.pr/PM-digital"><em>in Apple Podcasts</em></a><em> or at </em><a href="https://n.pr/3HlREPz"><em>plus.npr.org/planetmoney</em></a><em>.</em><br/><br/>Learn more about sponsor message choices: <a href="https://podcastchoices.com/adchoices">podcastchoices.com/adchoices</a><br/><br/><a href="https://www.npr.org/about-npr/179878450/privacy-policy">NPR Privacy Policy</a>]]></description>

      <title>A very Planet Money Thanksgiving</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Here at Planet Money, Thanksgiving is not just a time to feast on turkey, stuffing, mashed potatoes, green bean casseroles and pie(s). It's also a time to feast on economics. Today, we host a very Planet Money Thanksgiving feast, and solve a few economic questions along the way.<br/><br/>First: a turkey mystery. Around the holidays, demand for turkey at grocery stores goes up by as much as 750%.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[Here at Planet Money, Thanksgiving is not just a time to feast on turkey, stuffing, mashed potatoes, green bean casseroles and pie(s). It's also a time to feast on economics. Today, we host a very Planet Money Thanksgiving feast, and solve a few economic questions along the way.<br/><br/>First: a turkey mystery. Around the holidays, demand for turkey at grocery stores goes up by as much as 750%. And when turkey demand is so high, you might think that the price of turkey would also go up. <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0165176523000575">But data shows</a>, the price of whole turkeys actually falls around the holidays; it goes down by around 20%.

      <title>The alleged theft at the heart of ChatGPT</title>
      <description><![CDATA[When best-selling thriller writer Douglas Preston began playing around with OpenAI's new chatbot, ChatGPT, he was, at first, impressed. But then he realized how much in-depth knowledge GPT had of the books he had written. When prompted, it supplied detailed plot summaries and descriptions of even minor characters. He was convinced it could only pull that off if it had read his books.<br/><br/>Large language models, the kind of artificial intelligence underlying programs like ChatGPT, do not come into the world fully formed. They first have to be trained on incredibly large amounts of text. Douglas Preston, and 16 other authors, including George R.R. Martin, Jodi Piccoult, and Jonathan Franzen, were convinced that their novels had been used to train GPT without their permission. So, in September, they sued OpenAI for copyright infringement.<br/><br/>This sort of thing seems to be happening a lot lately–one giant tech company or another "moves fast and breaks things," exploring the edges of what might or might not be allowed without first asking permission. On today's show, we try to make sense of what OpenAI allegedly did by training its AI on massive amounts of copyrighted material. Was that good? Was it bad?

      <title>Never have I ever</title>
      <description><![CDATA[The world of economics has these two different sides. One one side, there are the economists in their cozy armchairs and dusty libraries, high up in their ivory towers. On the other, there's the messy world we're all living in, where those economics are actually playing out. <br/><br/>Sometimes, researchers will write about something that they themselves have never actually experienced. Sure, they've thought about it, theorized, come up with smart analyses...but that's not the same as getting out of that armchair and into the real world.<br/><br/>So, in this episode, we play our own version of Never Have I Ever. We dare two researchers to go places and do things they have never done before, in hopes of learning something new about the economic world around us. <br/><br/>(Okay, fine, it's maybe more like Truth or Dare...but go with us here.)<br/><br/><em>Today's episode was hosted by Alexi Horowitz-Ghazi and produced by Emma Peaslee with help from Willa Rubin.

      <title>FTC Chair Lina Khan on Antitrust in the age of Amazon</title>
      <description><![CDATA[When Lina Khan was in law school back in 2017, she wrote a law review article called 'Amazon's Antitrust Paradox,' that went kinda viral in policy circles. In it, she argued that antitrust enforcement in the U.S. was behind the times. For decades, regulators had focused narrowly on consumer welfare, and they'd bring companies to court only when they thought consumers were being harmed by things like rising prices. But in the age of digital platforms like Amazon and Facebook, Khan argued in the article, the time had come for a more proactive approach to antitrust.<br/><br/>Just four years later, President Biden appointed Lina Khan to be the Chair of the Federal Trade Commission, one of the main government agencies responsible for enforcing antitrust in America, putting her in the rare position of putting some of her ideas into practice.<br/><br/>Now, two years into the job, Khan has taken some big swings at big tech companies like Meta and Microsoft. But the FTC has also faced a couple of big losses in the courts. On today's show, a conversation with FTC Chair Lina Khan on what it's like to try to turn audacious theory into bureaucratic practice, the FTC's new lawsuit against Amazon, and what it all means for business as usual. <br/><br/><em>Help support Planet Money and get bonus episodes by subscribing to Planet Money+ in </em><a href="http://n.pr/PM-digital"><em>Apple Podcasts</em></a><em> or at </em><a href="https://n.pr/3HlREPz"><em>plus.npr.org/planetmoney</em></a><em>.</em><br/><br/>Learn more about sponsor message choices: <a href="https://podcastchoices.com/adchoices">podcastchoices.com/adchoices</a><br/><br/><a href="https://www.npr.org/about-npr/179878450/privacy-policy">NPR Privacy Policy</a>]]></description>

      <title>Antitrust in America (classic)</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Earlier this fall, the Federal Trade Commission filed a high-stakes lawsuit against Amazon.<br/><br/>In that suit, the FTC claims Amazon is a monopoly, and it accuses the company of using anti-competitive tactics to hold onto its market power. It's a big case, with implications for consumers and businesses and digital marketplaces, and for antitrust law itself. That is the highly important but somewhat obscure body of law that deals with competition and big business.<br/><br/>And so, this week on Planet Money, we are doing a deep dive on the history of antitrust. It begins with today's episode, a Planet Money double feature. Two classic episodes that tell the story of how the U.S. government's approach to big business and competition has changed over time.<br/><br/>First, the story of a moment more than 100 years ago, when the government stepped into the free market in a big way to make competition work. It's the story of John D. Rockefeller and Standard Oil, and a muckraking journalist named Ida Tarbell.<br/><br/>Then, we fast forward to a turning point that took antitrust in the other direction. This is the story of a lawyer named Robert Bork, who transformed the way courts would interpret antitrust law.<br/><br/><em>These episodes were produced by Sally Helm with help from Alexi Horowitz Ghazi.

      <title>All you can eat economics</title>
      <description><![CDATA[You might expect to find economic concepts in the pages of an economics textbook. But you know where you can really see a lot of economic concepts in action? Buffets.<br/><br/>Here at Planet Money we believe there's a lot of economics going on at the all-you-eat buffet, tucked in between the mountains of brisket and troughs of mashed potatoes. From classic concepts like adverse selection, sunk costs, diminishing marginal returns, to more exotic economic mysteries, like the flat rate pricing bias.<br/><br/>Today on the show, we're headed to the place where the modern buffet may have been born: Las Vegas. Our mission? To feast ourselves on all the economics we can handle at the all-you-can-eat buffet. And along the way, an economist and fellow buffet-lover will teach us his hyper-rational strategy for optimizing his buffet experience.<br/><br/><em>Today's show was produced by James Sneed and Nick Fountain with help from Emma Peaslee.

      <title>Cutting school... by 20%</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Right now, a lot of school districts across the country are making a pretty giant change to the way public education usually works. Facing teacher shortages and struggling to fill vacant spots, they are finding a new recruitment tool: the four-day school week.<br/><br/>Those districts are saying to teachers, "You can have three-day weekends all the time, and we won't cut your pay." As of this fall, around 900 school districts – that's about 7% of all districts in the U.S. – now have school weeks that are just four days long.<br/><br/>And this isn't the first time a bunch of schools have scaled back to four days, so there is a lot of data to lean on to figure out how well it works.  In this episode, teachers love the four-day school week, and it turns out even parents love it, too. But is it good for students?<br/><br/><em>This episode was produced by Sam Yellowhorse Kesler with help from Willa Rubin. It was edited by Molly Messick and engineered by Maggie Luthar.

      <title>How unions are stopped before they start</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Union membership in the U.S. has been declining for decades. But, in 2022, <em>support </em>for unions among Americans was the <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/398303/approval-labor-unions-highest-point-1965.aspx#:~:text=WASHINGTON%2C%20D.C.%20%2D%2D%20Seventy%2Done,on%20this%20measure%20since%201965">highest</a> it's been in decades. This dissonance is due, in part, to the difficulties of one important phase in the life cycle of a union: setting up a union in the first place. One place where that has been particularly clear is at the Volkswagen plant in Chattanooga, Tennessee.<br/><br/>Back in 2008, Volkswagen announced that they would be setting up production in the United States after a 20-year absence. They planned to build a new auto manufacturing plant in Chattanooga. <br/><br/>Volkswagen has plants all over the world, all of which have some kind of worker representation, and the company said that it wanted that for Chattanooga too. So, the United Auto Workers, the union that traditionally represents auto workers, thought they would be able to successfully unionize this plant. <br/><br/>They were wrong.<br/><br/>In this episode, we tell the story of the UAW's 10-year fight to unionize the Chattanooga plant. And, what other unions can learn from how badly that fight went for labor. <br/><br/><em>This episode was hosted by Amanda Aronczyk and Nick Fountain. It was produced by Willa Rubin.

And, what other unions can learn from how badly that fight went for labor. <br/><br/><em>This episode was hosted by Amanda Aronczyk and Nick Fountain. It was produced by Willa Rubin.

      <title>Maria Bamford gets personal (about) finance</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<em>Note: There is swearing in this episode</em>.<br/><br/>In 2017, The University of Minnesota asked comedian Maria Bamford to give their commencement speech. But the University may not have known what it was in for. In her speech, Bamford told the crowd of graduates how much the university offered to pay her (nothing), her counteroffer ($20,000), and the amount they settled on ($10,000), which (after taxes and fees, etc.) she gave away to students in the audience to pay down their student loans.<br/><br/>Maria Bamford is a big believer in full disclosure of her finances, a philosophy she's adopted after decades in a Debtors Anonymous support group. In meetings, she learned important financial tips and tricks to go from thousands of dollars in debt to her current net worth of $3.5 million (a number which, true to her philosophy, she will share with anyone).<br/><br/>She spoke with us about her financial issues, how she recovered, and why she believes in total financial transparency, even when it makes her look kinda bad.<br/><br/><em>Disclaimer: Planet Money is not qualified or certified to give financial advice.

      <title>A man, a plan, wind power, Uruguay</title>
      <description><![CDATA[In 2007, Uruguay had a massive problem with no obvious fix. The economy of this country of 3.5 million people was growing, but there wasn't enough energy to power all that growth.<br/><br/>Ramón Méndez Galain was, at the time, a particle physicist, but he wanted to apply his scientific mind to this issue. He started researching different energy sources and eventually wrote up a plan for how Uruguay's power grid could transition to renewable energy. It would be better for the climate, and, he thought, in the long run it would be the most economical choice Uruguay could make.<br/><br/>Méndez Galain shared his plan online and in a series of informal lectures. Then, one day he received a phone call from the office of the president of Uruguay, inviting him to put his plan into action.<br/><br/>Countries all over the world have announced lofty goals to reduce the emissions that cause climate change.

      <title>The flight attendants of CHAOS</title>
      <description><![CDATA[When contract negotiations between Alaska Airlines and their flight attendants' union broke down in 1993, the union had a choice to make.<br/><br/>The union — The Association of Flight Attendants-CWA — knew that if they chose to strike, Alaska Airlines could use a plan. While Alaska Airlines technically couldn't fire someone on strike, they could permanently replace the striking flight attendants with new workers. Essentially, if the union went on strike, they could risk thousands of people's jobs. The flight attendants knew they needed a counter-strategy.<br/><br/>They went with a strategy they called CHAOS: "Create Havoc Around Our System."<br/><br/>The strategy had two phases. Phase one: The union kept Alaska guessing about when, where, and how a strike might happen. They kept everyone, even their own members, in the dark. And in turn, Alaska Airlines had to be prepared for a strike at any place and any time. Phase two was to go on strike in a targeted and strategic way.<br/><br/>The havoc that the flight attendants created set off a sort-of labor-dispute arms race and would go on to inspire strikes today. And, it showed how powerful it can be to introduce a little chaos into negotiations.<br/><br/><em>Help support Planet Money and get bonus episodes by subscribing to Planet Money+ in </em><a href="http://n.pr/PM-digital"><em>Apple Podcasts</em></a><em> or at </em><a href="https://n.pr/3HlREPz"><em>plus.npr.org/planetmoney</em></a><em>.</em><br/><br/>Learn more about sponsor message choices: <a href="https://podcastchoices.com/adchoices">podcastchoices.com/adchoices</a><br/><br/><a href="https://www.npr.org/about-npr/179878450/privacy-policy">NPR Privacy Policy</a>]]></description>

Phase two was to go on strike in a targeted and strategic way.<br/><br/>The havoc that the flight attendants created set off a sort-of labor-dispute arms race and would go on to inspire strikes today.

      <description><![CDATA[There seems to be headlines about floods, wildfires, or hurricanes every week. Scientists say this might be the new normal — that climate change is making natural disasters more and more common.<br/><br/>Tatyana Deryugina is a leading expert on the economics of natural disasters — how we respond to them, how they affect the economy, and how they change our lives. And back when Tatyana first started researching natural disasters she realized that there's a lot we don't know about their long-term economic consequences. Especially about how individuals and communities recover.<br/><br/>Trying to understand those questions of how we respond to natural disasters is a big part of Tatyana's research.

      <title>A black market, a currency crisis, and a tango competition in Argentina</title>
      <description><![CDATA[The Nobel-prize winning economist Simon Kuznets once analyzed the world's economies this way — he said there are four kinds of countries: developed, underdeveloped, Japan... and Argentina.<br/><br/>If you want to understand what happens when inflation really goes off the rails, go to Argentina. Annual inflation there, over the past year, was 124 percent. Argentina's currency, the peso, is collapsing, its poverty rate is above 40 percent, and the country may be on the verge of electing a far right Libertarian president who promises to replace the peso with the dollar. Even in a country that is already deeply familiar with economic chaos, this is dramatic.<br/><br/>In this episode, we travel to Argentina to try to understand: what is it like to live in an economy that's on the edge? With the help of our tango dancer guide, we meet all kinds of people who are living through record inflation and political upheaval. Because even as Argentina's economy tanks, its annual Mundial de Tango – the biggest tango competition in the world – that show is still on.<br/><br/><em>This episode was hosted by Amanda Aronczyk and Erika Beras.

      <title>How to launder $600 million on the internet</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Erin Plante is a private detective who specializes in chasing down stolen cryptocurrency. In March of 2022, she got the biggest assignment of her career: Hackers had broken into an online game called Axie Infinity and made off with over $600 million worth of digital money.<br/><br/>It was the largest crypto heist in history. And now it was Erin's job to find that money and get it back. Erin's investigation would lead her to face off against some of the world's most formidable digital money launderers, whose actions would soon raise alarms at the highest levels of government — even threaten the nuclear security of the entire planet.<br/><br/><em>This episode was hosted by Jeff Guo and Keith Romer, produced by James Sneed, edited by Jess Jiang, fact-checked by Willa Rubin & Sam Yellowhorse Kesler, and engineered by Maggie Luthar.

      <title>Is economists' favorite tool to crush inflation broken?</title>
      <description><![CDATA[When economists and policymakers talk about getting inflation under control, there's an assumption they often make: bringing inflation down will probably result in some degree of layoffs and job loss. But that is not the way things have played out since inflation spiked last year. Instead, so far, inflation has come down, and unemployment has stayed low.<br/><br/>So where does the idea of this tradeoff – between inflation and unemployment – come from? <br/><br/>That story starts in the 1940s, with a soft-spoken electrical engineer-turned-crocodile hunter-turned-economist named Bill Phillips. Phillips was consumed by the notion that there are underlying forces at work in the economy. He thought that if macroeconomists could only understand how those forces work, they could keep the economy stable.<br/><br/>On today's show, how the Phillips Curve was born, why it went mainstream, and why universal truths remain elusive in macroeconomics. <br/><br/><em>This episode was hosted by Willa Rubin and Nick Fountain, and produced by Sam Yellowhorse Kesler.

      <title>The prince of prints and his prints of Prince</title>
      <description><![CDATA[In 1981, photographer Lynn Goldsmith took a portrait of the musician Prince. It's a pretty standard headshot — it's in black-and-white, and Prince is staring down the camera lens.<br/><br/>This was early in his career, when he was still building the pop icon reputation he would have today. And in 1984, shortly after Prince had released <em>Purple Rain</em>, he was chosen to grace the cover of Vanity Fair. The magazine commissioned pop culture icon Andy Warhol to make a portrait of Prince for the cover. He used Lynn Goldsmith's photo, created a silkscreen from it, added some artistic touches, and instead of black-and-white, colored the face purple and set it against a red background. Warhol was paid, Goldsmith was paid, and both were given credit.<br/><br/>However, years later, after both Prince and Warhol had passed away, Goldsmith saw her portrait back out in the world again. But this time, the face was orange, and Goldsmith wasn't given money or credit. And what began as a typical question of payment for work, led to a firestorm in the Supreme Court. At the center of it, dozens of questions of what makes art unique. And at what point does a derivative work become transformative? The answer, it seems, has to do less with what art critics think, and more with what the market thinks.<em><br/><br/>Help support Planet Money and get bonus episodes by subscribing to Planet Money+ </em><a href="http://n.pr/PM-digital"><em>in Apple Podcasts</em></a><em> or at </em><a href="https://n.pr/3HlREPz"><em>plus.npr.org/planetmoney</em></a><em>.</em><br/><br/>Learn more about sponsor message choices: <a href="https://podcastchoices.com/adchoices">podcastchoices.com/adchoices</a><br/><br/><a href="https://www.npr.org/about-npr/179878450/privacy-policy">NPR Privacy Policy</a>]]></description>

      <title>How to fight a patent pirate</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Back in the 1990s, Dr. Raghunath Mashelkar was in his office in New Delhi when he came across a puzzling story in the newspaper. Some university scientists in the U.S. had apparently filed a patent for using turmeric to help heal wounds. Mashelkar was shocked, because he knew that using turmeric that way was a well known remedy in traditional Indian medicine. And he knew that patents are for brand new inventions. So, he decided to do something about it – to go to battle against the turmeric patent.<br/><br/>But as he would soon discover, turmeric wasn't the only piece of traditional or indigenous knowledge that had been claimed in Western patent offices. The practice even had its own menacing nickname - <em>biopiracy</em>. And what started out as a plan to rescue one Indian remedy from the clutches of the U.S. patent office, eventually turned into a much bigger mission – to build a new kind of digital fortress, strong enough to keep even the most rapacious of bio-pirates at bay.<br/><br/><em>This episode was produced by Willa Rubin with help from James Sneed and Emma Peaslee.

We are going to put our own spin on a pitch competition like you see on Shark Tank. We hear from five listeners with real ideas for startups.<br/><br/>Can they make a successful pitch? What will investors be looking for in their presentation? Can they come prepared with persuasive total addressable market analyses? Who will have the sharpest customer pain points to solve? We shall see.<br/><br/>Our business expert will give us a rare glimpse into the mind of investors and what they're looking for. Only one graduate will be crowned the winner as this year's valedictorian. <br/><br/>If you want to get your diploma right now, <a href="http://npr.org/2023/08/23/1195565501/mba-summer-school-exam-quiz">take the 2023 Planet Money Summer School Quiz to earn your diploma!</a><br/><br/>If you share it on social media, tag us so we can celebrate with you.<br/><br/><a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/07/15/884827691/planet-money-summer-school?"><em>Find all episodes of Planet Money Summer School here.</em></a><br/><br/>Learn more about sponsor message choices: <a href="https://podcastchoices.com/adchoices">podcastchoices.com/adchoices</a><br/><br/><a href="https://www.npr.org/about-npr/179878450/privacy-policy">NPR Privacy Policy</a>]]></description>

      <title>The secret entrance that sidesteps Hollywood picket lines</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Across Hollywood right now, writers and actors are picketing in front of studio lots. They're walking back and forth, holding up signs demanding concessions on things like pay, how many writers work on projects, and the use of AI in TV and movies.<br/><br/>But, on some of these lots, there are these strange <em>alternate</em> entrances where there are no picketers.

      <title>Summer School 7: Negotiating and the empathetic nibble</title>
      <description><![CDATA[How do you get the best deal? How do you <em>know</em> you're getting the best deal? Whether you're talking down the price of a car or talking <em>up</em> your salary, you don't have to be a jerk to get what you want. Negotiations can be win-win – if you know what to ask for and how to grow the pie.<br/><br/>We have three stories in today's episode about how to negotiate tactically. First, a hostage negotiator tries to buy a car. Will he get far? Then, one man's encounter at the airline ticket booth may inform how you respond to your next job offer. Finally, how to avoid a food fight and make a deal that benefits everybody.<br/><br/>We'll learn about something called BATNA, or best alternative to a negotiated agreement, which can tell you when to stand firm and when to walk away. We'll find out how to shift our thinking about what success can look like in a negotiation, and shift your counterpart's thinking too.<br/><br/>Come learn the techniques of expert negotiators in the penultimate episode of Planet Money Summer School, MBA edition. Next week: Graduation! So, you have one week to negotiate the cost of your cap and gown.<br/><br/><em>Our Summer School series is hosted by Robert Smith and produced by Max Freedman.

      <title>Vacation, and why the U.S. takes so little of it</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Do you work more for more money? Or work less for more time? For some, this is the ultimate economic choice.<br/><br/>Every single worker in the European Union is guaranteed four weeks of paid vacation. No matter how long they've been at a company. No matter how low paying the job is. Vacation is a right.<br/><br/>In fact, all but one of the richest countries in the world guarantees paid vacation, except: the U.S.<br/><br/>According to a 2019 study, people in Japan get 10 paid vacation days and 15 paid holidays; in Australia it's 20 paid vacation days and 8 paid holidays; and in Spain it's 25 paid vacation days and 14 paid holidays.<br/><br/>And it's not just a rich country thing: Mexico, Afghanistan, Thailand, Tanzania - they all guarantee paid vacation from work, at least in the formal job sector.<br/><br/>In the U.S: Zero paid vacation days and zero paid holidays. So, why is the United States the outlier? We go to several labor economists and historians, to find out what makes Americans different from Europeans. It's a winding journey, so maybe put in a request for some paid time off and take a listen!<br/><br/><em>This episode was hosted by Sarah Gonzalez, produced by Sam Yellowhorse Kesler, edited by Jess Jiang, engineered by Maggie Luthar, and fact-checked by Sierra Juarez.

      <title>Summer School 6: Operations and 25,000 roses</title>
      <description><![CDATA["It's difficult to control everything," says our guest professor for this week, Santiago Gallino. "What is not difficult is to plan for everything." Today we venture into the sphere of business that masters the planning, and backup planning: operations management.<br/><br/>It's more than just predicting a bottleneck and imagining a solution, because there's always a bottleneck to clear. It's about modeling, and weighing the costs of messing up vs. missing out. For instance, take a newspaper vendor who has to decide how many newspapers to sell tomorrow morning. Do they buy fewer, knowing that they'll sell out–and then miss out on potential revenue from papers not sold? Or do they order more than they expect to sell, just in case–and eat the cost of a few unsold papers? This type of trade-off applies to all kinds of businesses, and Gallino talks us through how to choose.<br/><br/>The only certainty in this life is uncertainty. But we are certain you will come out of this episode feeling better prepared for your future business. And fortunately, there are no bottlenecks in podcasting.<br/><br/><em>The series is hosted by Robert Smith and produced by Max Freedman. Our project manager is Julia Carney.

      <title>The new Biden plan that could still erase your student loans</title>
      <description><![CDATA[This summer, the Supreme Court struck down Biden's plan to forgive student loan debt for millions of borrowers. Except, on the same day Biden first announced that plan, he also unveiled <em>another, </em>the SAVE plan. And though SAVE sounded less significant than Biden's big forgiveness pledge, it's still alive and could erase even more student debt.<br/><br/>SAVE is officially a loan repayment plan. But through a few seemingly minor yet powerful provisions, many more low-income borrowers will end up paying little or nothing until, eventually, their loans will be forgiven. Even many higher-income borrowers will see some of their debts erased.<br/><br/>In this episode, we explain the history of income-driven repayment. And how borrowers could end up paying less than they might expect once payments resume in October.

      <title>Summer School 5: Tech and the innovator's dilemma</title>
      <description><![CDATA[For anyone running a business, technology is both threat and opportunity. Today, we run through techniques entrepreneurs can use to take advantage of new tech or defend against the dangers. It's not just about the product you're selling. It's about consumer psychology, and ethics, and taking calculated risks to navigate uncertainty.<br/><br/>But, since this is Planet Money Summer School and we want to set your business on the path to riches, we're going to talk about how to use tech to dream big. Maybe more than anything, technology creates opportunities for the little guys where the big established companies can't be so nimble or have too much to lose. <br/><br/>Take the classic concept of the innovator's dilemma: a company that innovated and succeeded, now faces a choice about any disruptive new technology. Do they risk tossing out their existing advantage and switch to the new tech, or play it safe and risk becoming obsolete?<br/><br/>Most new technologies don't end up disrupting an industry. So it is totally rational for the big existing companies to ignore each new flash in the pan. But nobody wants to end up like Kodak: sticking with film while the digital camera takes off. So what to do? <br/><br/>Our friendly professor has a few ideas – for the little guy and the big old company. He'll explain the shape of how new technology gets adopted, sometimes called the S curve. We'll also hear examples of what stops promising new tech from taking off: from dishwashers to driverless cars, and even the humble elevator.<br/><br/>Learn more about sponsor message choices: <a href="https://podcastchoices.com/adchoices">podcastchoices.com/adchoices</a><br/><br/><a href="https://www.npr.org/about-npr/179878450/privacy-policy">NPR Privacy Policy</a>]]></description>

      <title>A tarot card reading for the U.S. economy</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Predicting the future of the economy is always a dicey proposition. That is especially true after more than three years of pandemic-related economic weirdness. No one quite knows what will happen next.<br/><br/>Will the Fed be able to pull off a soft landing and bring down inflation without causing either a recession or a big jump in unemployment? Or will we end up with a hard landing, in which inflation comes down, but at the price of the country's economic health? Or, a third possibility, will the Fed not successfully bring inflation down at all?<br/><br/>On today's show, three economic experts explain what they look for when trying to make predictions about what might come next for the U.S. economy. And how those indicators lead them to very different conclusions. We will also consult a tarot card reader...to see if her reading of the future can help us know which outcome is the most likely.<br/><br/><em>This episode was hosted by Keith Romer, Sarah Gonzalez, and Jeff Guo.

      <title>Summer School 4: Marketing and the Ultimate Hose Nozzle</title>
      <description><![CDATA[In this session of Planet Money Summer School, we are getting the word out about your brand. How do you convince consumers to buy your product, even if they are only just hearing about it? It's time for sales and marketing!<br/><br/>If you've watched a show like <em>Mad Men</em> or <em>The Office</em>, you know the importance of a strong pitch. It's precision-crafted to show how what you're selling can solve a problem your customer needs solved. Sometimes it even creates the need. Once you've got your sales pitch, it's time to get the word out: marketing. Where to spread that message? How to make it unforgettable? Instantly recognizable? What is going to be your <em>Just do it</em>? Your <em>Think different</em>? Your <em>Where's the beef</em>?<br/><br/>In our case studies today, we look at a product so cleverly marketed, the company doesn't need to market it at all anymore and customers wait years to get it: the Birkin bag. And we hear lessons from some of the world's most time tested salespeople who can and do sell <em>anything</em>, literally. It's all about the four P's: Product, place, promotion and price. Also, a few other tricks we test out. <br/><br/><a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/07/15/884827691/planet-money-summer-school?">Find all episodes of Planet Money Summer School here.</a><br/><br/><em>This series is hosted by Robert Smith, and produced by Max Freedman.

      <title>Did two honesty researchers fabricate their data?</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Dan Ariely and Francesca Gino are two of the biggest stars in behavioral science. Both have conducted blockbuster research into how to make people more honest, research <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/money/2015/07/15/423282438/episode-638-tweak-the-world">we've highlighted</a> on <em>Planet Money</em>. The two worked together on a <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1209746109">paper</a> about how to "nudge" people to be more honest on things like forms or tax returns. Their trick: move the location where people attest that they have filled in a form honestly from the bottom of the form to the top.<br/><br/>But recently, questions have arisen about whether the data Ariely and Gino relied on in their famous paper about honesty were fabricated — whether their research into honesty was itself built on lies. The blog Data Colada went looking for clues in the <a href="https://datacolada.org/109">cells of the studies' Excel spreadsheets</a>, the <a href="https://datacolada.org/98">shapes of their data distributions</a>, and even the fonts that were used.<br/><br/>The Hartford, an insurance company that collaborated with Ariely on one implicated study, told NPR this week in a statement that it could confirm that the data it had provided for that study had been altered had been altered after they gave it to Ariely, but prior to the research's publication: "It is clear the data was manipulated inappropriately and supplemented by synthesized or fabricated data." <br/><br/>Ariely denies that he was responsible for the falsified data. "Getting the data file was the extent of my involvement with the data," he told NPR.<br/><br/><em>Help support Planet Money and get bonus episodes by subscribing to Planet Money+ </em><a href="http://n.pr/PM-digital"><em>in Apple Podcasts</em></a><em> or at </em><a href="https://n.pr/3HlREPz"><em>plus.npr.org/planetmoney</em></a><em>.</em><br/><br/>Learn more about sponsor message choices: <a href="https://podcastchoices.com/adchoices">podcastchoices.com/adchoices</a><br/><br/><a href="https://www.npr.org/about-npr/179878450/privacy-policy">NPR Privacy Policy</a>]]></description>

The two worked together on a <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1209746109">paper</a> about how to "nudge" people to be more honest on things like forms or tax returns. Their trick: move the location where people attest that they have filled in a form honestly from the bottom of the form to the top.<br/><br/>But recently, questions have arisen about whether the data Ariely and Gino relied on in their famous paper about honesty were fabricated — whether their research into honesty was itself built on lies. The blog Data Colada went looking for clues in the <a href="https://datacolada.org/109">cells of the studies' Excel spreadsheets</a>, the <a href="https://datacolada.org/98">shapes of their data distributions</a>, and even the fonts that were used.<br/><br/>The Hartford, an insurance company that collaborated with Ariely on one implicated study, told NPR this week in a statement that it could confirm that the data it had provided for that study had been altered had been altered after they gave it to Ariely, but prior to the research's publication: "It is clear the data was manipulated inappropriately and supplemented by synthesized or fabricated data." <br/><br/>Ariely denies that he was responsible for the falsified data. "Getting the data file was the extent of my involvement with the data," he told NPR.<br/><br/><em>Help support Planet Money and get bonus episodes by subscribing to Planet Money+ </em><a href="http://n.pr/PM-digital"><em>in Apple Podcasts</em></a><em> or at </em><a href="https://n.pr/3HlREPz"><em>plus.npr.org/planetmoney</em></a><em>.</em><br/><br/>Learn more about sponsor message choices: <a href="https://podcastchoices.com/adchoices">podcastchoices.com/adchoices</a><br/><br/><a href="https://www.npr.org/about-npr/179878450/privacy-policy">NPR Privacy Policy</a>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Summer School 3: Accounting and The Last Supper</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Usually, the first class that an MBA student takes is accounting. That involves, yes, equations and counting widgets...but it's more than that. Inside the simple act of accounting is a revolutionary way of thinking not just about a business, but about the world. A universe where all the forces are in balance. Accounting gives you a sixth sense–one that can help you determine whether your business will survive or fail.<br/><br/>In this class, you'll learn the basics of accounting, and uncover its origins. We'll introduce you to the man who helped it spread around the world. He was a monk, a magician, and possibly the boyfriend of Leonardo da Vinci.<br/><br/>Is accounting... sexy?<br/><br/>Yes.

      <description><![CDATA[We here at Planet Money love economics papers. And that is also the case for so many of the economists we speak with.  For them, new research can explain something they have always wondered about, or make them see something they have never noticed before. And it inspires their own work. <br/><br/>So, to bring that same sense of discovery to you, the listener, today we are dedicating our show to a special experiment. A new way to share some of the most fascinating, clever and surprising economics papers in a segment we're calling: The Econ Paper Club.<br/><br/>On today's show, we read the econ papers so you don't have to. We take a joyous romp through some of the most fascinating ideas floating around economics right now. And we find that some of those fascinating ideas are about some of the biggest things in life: the careers we choose, the expectations that come with parenting and what one eminent economist calls 'greedy jobs.' <br/><br/><em>This episode was hosted by Erika Beras and Kenny Malone.

      <title>Summer School 1: Planet Money goes to business school</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<em></em><a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/07/15/884827691/planet-money-summer-school"><em>Find all episodes of Planet Money Summer School here</em></a><em>.</em><br/><br/>Planet Money Summer School is back! It's the free economics class you can take from anywhere... for everyone! For Season 4 of Summer School, we are taking you to business school.

      <title>The quest to save macroeconomics from itself</title>
      <description><![CDATA[When it comes to big questions about the economy, we're still kind of in the dark ages. Why do some economies grow so much faster than others? How long is the next recession going to last? How do we stop inflation without wrecking the rest of the economy? These questions are the domain of macroeconomics. But even some macroeconomists themselves admit: While we have many theories about how the economy works, we have very few satisfying answers.<br/><br/>Emi Nakamura wants to change all that. She's a superstar economist who is a pioneer in the field of "empirical macroeconomics." She finds clever ways of using data to untangle some of the oldest mysteries in macroeconomics, about the invisible hand, the consequences of government spending, and the inner workings of inflation.<br/><br/>Recently we called her up to ask her why the economy is so difficult to understand in first place, and how she's trying to find answers anyway. She gets into all of that, and how Jeff Goldblum shaped her career as an economist, in this episode. <br/><br/><em>This show was hosted by Jeff Guo and Nick Fountain.

      <title>Two Indicators: After Affirmative Action &amp; why America overpays for subways</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Two stories today.<br/><br/>First, as we start to understand post-affirmative action America, we look to a natural experiment 25 years ago, when California ended the practice in public universities. It reshaped the makeup of the universities almost instantly. We find out what happened in the decades that followed.<br/><br/>Then, we ask, why does it cost so much for America to build big things, like subways. Compared to other wealthy nations, the costs of infrastructure projects in the U.S. are astronomical. We take a trip to one of the most expensive subway stations in the world to get to the bottom of why American transit is so expensive to build.<br/><br/><em>This episode was hosted by Adrian Ma and Darian Woods.

      <title>Planet Money Live: Two Truths and a Lie</title>
      <description><![CDATA[The shocks of the pandemic economy gave us a bunch of enormous natural experiments, which helped to prove or disprove conventional economic thinking.<br/><br/>Take, for example, the <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/10/20/1047777081/keep-calm-its-just-the-bullwhip-effect">bullwhip effect</a>, the idea that the further away from the customer you are in the supply chain, the more volatile your orders are likely to be. This theory played out at an enormous scale, in the pandemic. Consumers and companies overreacted to the risk of shortages by ordering more products and hoarding them, causing massive shifts in the supply chain – just like the theory says.<br/><br/>And the pandemic gave us a lot of natural experiments like this. So, on this special live edition of Planet Money, we looked for other big economic lessons from the past three years, and we took this information and turned it into... a gameshow! It's Two Truths and a Lie: Econ Edition. We get into questions about the workforce and labor market during the pandemic, and how it affected how economists view the world.<br/><br/><em>This episode was hosted by Mary Childs.

      <title>Mike The Mover vs. The Furniture Police</title>
      <description><![CDATA[In 1978, a young man named Mike Shanks started a moving business in the north end of Seattle. It was just him and a truck — a pretty small operation.

Things were going great.

Mike calls them the <em>furniture police</em>. To legally be a mover, Mike needed a license. Otherwise, he'd face fines — and even potentially jail time.

      <title>Twins (classic)</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Twins are used to fielding all sorts of questions, like "Can you read each other's minds?" or "Can you feel each other's pain?" Two of our Planet Money reporters are twins, and they have heard them all.<br/><br/>But it's not just strangers on the street who are fascinated by twins. Scientists have been studying twins since the 1800s, trying to get at one of humanity's biggest questions: How much of what we do and how we are is encoded in our genes? The answer to this has all kinds of implications, for everything from healthcare to education, criminal justice and government spending.<br/><br/>Today on the show, we look at the history of twin studies. We ask what decades of studying twins has taught us. We look back at a twin study that asked whether genes influence antisocial behavior and rule-breaking. One of our reporters was a subject in it. And we find out: are twin studies still important for science?<br/><br/><em>(Note: This episode originally ran in </em><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/13wshkNIJGHBQM7XSyDQ2-AbG1DP_6P_-uLFjPjHkuJc/edit"><em>2019</em></a><em>.)<br></em><br><em>Our show today was hosted by Sally Helm and Karen Duffin.

      <title>The 60-day job race</title>
      <description><![CDATA[People come from all over the world to work in U.S. tech. And during the tech boom years, the industry relied heavily on foreign workers. This is how we built Silicon Valley – with great minds coming from everywhere to work in the U.S.<br/><br/>But when the industry started to shrink, all of these people who moved here for work are finding that linking their jobs to their residency is really complicated. That was the case for Aashka and Nilanjan. Aashka was a product engineer at Amazon, and Nilanjan worked in digital advertising for Google. They both lost their jobs in the layoffs each company announced earlier this year.<br/><br/>When Aashka and Nilanjan got the news, a clock started ticking. Because they are both H-1B recipients, they only have 60 days to find new jobs before they risk being sent home. And they can't get just any job – they need new employers in their field willing to sponsor their visa.<br/><br/>On today's show, we followed two tech workers as they tried to find jobs before their visas expired, and what they went through as H-1B recipients trying to stay in the country.<br/><br/><em>This episode was hosted by Alyssa Jeong Perry and Amanda Aronczyk, produced by Sam Yellowhorse Kesler, engineered by James Willetts, fact-checked by Sierra Juarez, and edited by Molly Messick and Jess Jiang.<br/><br/>Help support Planet Money and get bonus episodes by subscribing to Planet Money+ in </em><a href="http://n.pr/PM-digital"><em>Apple Podcasts</em></a><em> or at </em><a href="https://n.pr/3HlREPz"><em>plus.npr.org/planetmoney</em></a><em>.</em><br/><br/>Learn more about sponsor message choices: <a href="https://podcastchoices.com/adchoices">podcastchoices.com/adchoices</a><br/><br/><a href="https://www.npr.org/about-npr/179878450/privacy-policy">NPR Privacy Policy</a>]]></description>

      <title>Two Indicators: The economics of innovation</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Innovation is crucial for game-changing advancements in society, whether it's treatments for serious diseases, developments in AI technology, or rocket science.<br/><br/>Today on the show, we're airing two episodes from our daily economics show The Indicator. First, a new paper suggests that breakthrough innovations are more likely at smaller, younger companies. We talk to an inventor who left a big pharmaceutical company to start afresh, leading to some incredible treatments for serious diseases.<br/><br/>Then, it's off to Mars — or at least, on the way. Elon Musk's company SpaceX did a first test launch of a rocket meant to go all the way to the red planet. The rocket made it up off of the launch pad and lumbered briefly through the sky before self-destructing over the Gulf of Mexico. Suffice it to say, it's not quite ready. NPR science correspondent Geoff Brumfiel walks us through SpaceX's business plan as we try to figure out if this company has the funding and business acumen to reach its moonshot goal.<br/><br/><em>These two Indicator episodes were originally produced by Corey Bridges & Brittany Cronin, engineered by Katherine Silva & James Willets, and fact-checked by Dylan Sloan & Sierra Juarez.

      <title>The town that changed economics</title>
      <description><![CDATA[In the early 90s, when a young economist named Michael Kremer finished his PhD, there had been a few economic studies based on randomized trials. But they were rare. In part because randomized trials – in which you recruit two statistically identical groups, choose one of them to get a treatment, and then compare what happens to each group – are expensive, and they take a lot of time.<br/><br/>But then, by chance, Michael had the opportunity to run a randomized trial in Busia, Kenya. He helped a nonprofit test whether the aid they were giving to local schools helped the students. That study paved the way for more randomized trials, and for other economists to use the method. <br/><br/>On today's show, how Busia, Kenya, became <em>the</em> place where economists pioneered a more scientific way to study huge problems, from contaminated water to low graduation rates, to HIV transmission. And how that research changed government programs and aid efforts around the world. <br/><br/><em>This episode was produced by James Sneed with help from Willa Rubin.

      <description><![CDATA[It's the thrilling conclusion to our three-part series on AI — the world premiere of the first episode of Planet Money written by AI. In Part 1 of this series, we taught AI how to write an original Planet Money script by feeding it real research and interviews. In Part 2, we used AI to clone the voice of our former colleague Robert Smith.<br/><br/>Now, we've put everything together into a 15-minute Planet Money episode. And we've gathered some of our co-hosts to listen along.<br/><br/>So, how did the AI do? You'll have to listen to learn what went surprisingly well, where it fell short, and hear reactions from the real-life hosts whose jobs could be at risk of being replaced by the machines. <br><em><br>This episode was produced by Emma Peaslee and Willa Rubin.

Then we introduce synthetic Robert to his very human namesake.<br/><br/>There are a lot of ethical, and economic, questions raised by a technology that can duplicate anyone's voice.

      <description><![CDATA[We used to think some jobs were safe from automation. Though machines have transformed industries like agriculture and manufacturing, the conventional wisdom was that they could never perform what's called "knowledge work." That the robots could never replace lawyers or accountants — or journalists, like us.<br/><br/>Well, ever since the release of artificial intelligence tools like ChatGPT, it feels like no job is safe. AI can now write essays, generate computer code, and even pass the bar exam. Will work ever be the same again?<br/><br/>Here at Planet Money, we are launching a new three-part series to understand what this new AI-powered future looks like. Our goal: to get the machines to make an entire Planet Money show. <br/><br/>In this first episode, we try to teach the AI how to write a script for us from scratch. Can the AI do research for us, interview our sources, and then stitch everything together in a creative, entertaining way? We're going to find out just how much of our own jobs we can automate — and what work might soon look like for us all.<br/><br/>(And, in case you're wondering... this text was not written by an AI.)<br/><br/><em>This episode was produced by Emma Peaslee and Willa Rubin.

      <title>Predictions: Jobs!</title>
      <description><![CDATA[It's time for another installment of ... <em>Planet Money Predictions</em>! *air horn* <br/><br/><a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/02/18/1081846617/predictions-inflation">Last year</a>, we invited two economic forecasters to tell us what they saw coming for jobs, the housing market, and inflation. And now they're back. Which means it's time to find out whose predictions were more on the money, and send the victor to the next round, where they face off against a new forecasting phenom. <br/><br/>Since our last game, housing and inflation have cooled, but the job market keeps going strong. And the possibility of a recession still looms large.

And now they're back. Which means it's time to find out whose predictions were more on the money, and send the victor to the next round, where they face off against a new forecasting phenom. <br/><br/>Since our last game, housing and inflation have cooled, but the job market keeps going strong. And the possibility of a recession still looms large. Our forecasters tell us what they see in the economy now, and what they expect in the months ahead.<br/><br/><em>This episode was produced by James Sneed. It was engineered by Katherine Silva.

      <title>How AI could help rebuild the middle class</title>
      <description><![CDATA[For the last four decades, technology has been mostly a force for greater inequality and a shrinking middle class. But new empirical evidence suggests that the age of AI could be different.

      <title>Inflation and the Profit-Price Spiral</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Economists say that inflation is just too much money chasing too few goods.<br/><br/>But something <em>else</em> can make inflation stick around.<br/><br/>If you think of the 1970s, the last time the U.S. had really high sustained inflation, a big concern was rising wages. Prices for goods and services were high. Workers expected prices to be even higher next year, so they asked for pay raises to keep up. But then companies had to raise their prices more. And then workers asked for raises again. This the so-called wage-price spiral.<br/><br/>So when prices started getting high again in 2021, economists and the U.S. Federal Reserve again worried that wage increases would become a big problem. But, it seems like the wage-price spiral hasn't happened. In fact wages, on average, have not kept up with inflation.<br/><br/>There are now concerns about a totally different kind of spiral: a <em>profit</em>-price spiral. On today's show, why some economists are looking at inflation in a new light.<br/><br/><em>This episode was produced by Sam Yellowhorse Kesler and engineered by Katherine Silva, with help from Josh Newell.

      <title>How to fight a squatting goat</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Back in 2005, Burt Banks inherited a plot of old family land in Delaware. But when it came time to sell it, he ran into a problem: his neighbor had a goat pen, and about half of it crossed over onto his property. <br/><br/>Burt asked the goats' owner to move the pen, but when neighborly persuasion failed to get the job done, he changed his strategy. He sued her. And that is when things got complicated.<br/><br/>Protecting private property is one of the fundamental jobs of the American legal system. If you hold a deed saying you own a plot of land, it's your land. End of story. Right?<br/><br/>But, as Burt would soon learn, the law can get really complicated when it comes to determining who <em>actually</em> owns something. And when goats are involved ... anything can happen.<br/><br/><em>This episode was produced by Willa Rubin and Dylan Sloan and edited by Molly Messick. It was fact-checked by Sierra Juarez.

      <title>Two Indicators: the influencer industry</title>
      <description><![CDATA[When you were little, what did you want to be when you grew up? An astronaut, a doctor or maybe a famous athlete? Today one of the most popular responses to that question is influencer – content creators who grow their following on Tik Tok, Instagram and YouTube and monetize that content to make it their full-time job.<br/><br/>In a lot of ways influencing can seem like the dream job - the filters, the followers, the free stuff. But on the internet, rarely is anything as it appears. From hate comments and sneaky contracts to prejudice and discrimination, influencers face a number of hurdles in their chosen careers.<br/><br/>This week we're bringing you two stories from our daily show <a href="https://www.npr.org/podcasts/510325/the-indicator-from-planet-money">The Indicator</a> on the promise and perils of the multi-billion dollar influencer industry.<br/><br/><em>This episode was produced by Corey Bridges and Janet Lee.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[When you were little, what did you want to be when you grew up? An astronaut, a doctor or maybe a famous athlete? Today one of the most popular responses to that question is influencer – content creators who grow their following on Tik Tok, Instagram and YouTube and monetize that content to make it their full-time job.<br/><br/>In a lot of ways influencing can seem like the dream job - the filters, the followers, the free stuff. But on the internet, rarely is anything as it appears. From hate comments and sneaky contracts to prejudice and discrimination, influencers face a number of hurdles in their chosen careers.<br/><br/>This week we're bringing you two stories from our daily show <a href="https://www.npr.org/podcasts/510325/the-indicator-from-planet-money">The Indicator</a> on the promise and perils of the multi-billion dollar influencer industry.<br/><br/><em>This episode was produced by Corey Bridges and Janet Lee.

      <title>Financial advising while Black</title>
      <description><![CDATA[After a successful career in advertising, Erika Williams decided it was time for a change. She went back to school to get an MBA at the University of Chicago, and eventually, in 2012, she got a job at Wells Fargo as a financial advisor. It was the very job she wanted.<br/><br/>Erika is Black–and being a Black financial advisor at a big bank is relatively uncommon. Banking was one of the last white collar industries to really hire Black employees. And when Erika gets to her office, she's barely situated before she starts to get a weird feeling. She feels like her coworkers are acting strangely around her.<br/><br/>"I was just met with a lot of stares. And then the stares just turned to just, I mean, they just pretty much ignored me. And that was my first day, and that was my second day. And it was really every day until I left."<br/><br/>She wasn't sure whether to call her experience racism...until she learned that there were other Black employees at other Wells Fargo offices feeling the exact same way.On today's episode, Erika's journey through these halls of money and power.

      <title>Tax Code Switch</title>
      <description><![CDATA[This past January, researchers uncovered that Black taxpayers are three to five times as likely to be audited as everyone else. One likely reason for this is that the IRS disproportionately audits lower-income earners who claim a tax benefit called the earned income tax credit. And this, says law professor Dorothy Brown, is just one example of the many ways that race is woven through our tax system, its history, and its enforcement.<br/><br/>Dorothy discovered the hidden relationship between race and the tax system sort of by accident, when she was helping her parents with their tax return. The amount they paid seemed too high. Eventually, her curiosity about that observation spawned a whole area of study.<br/><br/>This episode is a collaboration with NPR's Code Switch podcast.

      <title>The life and possible death of low interest rates</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Right now, the economy is running hot. Inflation is high, and central banks are pushing up interest rates to fight it. But before the pandemic, economies around the world were stuck in a different rut: low inflation, low interest rates, low growth. <br/><br/>In 2013, <a href="https://larrysummers.com/">Larry Summers</a> unearthed an old term from the Great Depression to explain why the economy was in this rut: secular stagnation. The theory resonated with <a href="https://www.piie.com/experts/senior-research-staff/olivier-blanchard?gclid=CjwKCAjw8-OhBhB5EiwADyoY1VsWki-DUWa3hP2HET7U6ipsdCrW5SlMmWjIBLmedVTMY8Gi53j5rhoCRIYQAvD_BwE">Olivier Blanchard</a>, another leading scholar, because he had made similar observations himself. Larry and Olivier would go on to build a case for why secular stagnation was a defining theory of the economy and why government policies needed to respond to it. They helped reshape many people's understanding of the economy, and suggested that this period of slow growth and low interest rates was here to stay for a long time.<br/><br/>But today, Larry and Olivier are no longer the duo they used to be. As inflation has spiked worldwide, interest rates have followed suit. Earlier this year, Larry announced that he was no longer on the secular stagnation train. Olivier, meanwhile, believes we're just going through a minor blip and will return to a period of low interest rates within the near future. He doesn't see the deep forces that led to a long-run decline in interest rates as just vanishing. Who's right? The future of the global economy could depend on the answer.<em><br/><br/>Help support Planet Money  by subscribing to Planet Money+ </em><a href="http://n.pr/PM-digital"><em>in Apple Podcasts</em></a><em> or at </em><a href="https://n.pr/3HlREPz"><em>plus.npr.org/planetmoney</em></a><em>.</em><br/><br/>Learn more about sponsor message choices: <a href="https://podcastchoices.com/adchoices">podcastchoices.com/adchoices</a><br/><br/><a href="https://www.npr.org/about-npr/179878450/privacy-policy">NPR Privacy Policy</a>]]></description>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[Right now, the economy is running hot. Inflation is high, and central banks are pushing up interest rates to fight it. But before the pandemic, economies around the world were stuck in a different rut: low inflation, low interest rates, low growth. <br/><br/>In 2013, <a href="https://larrysummers.com/">Larry Summers</a> unearthed an old term from the Great Depression to explain why the economy was in this rut: secular stagnation. The theory resonated with <a href="https://www.piie.com/experts/senior-research-staff/olivier-blanchard?gclid=CjwKCAjw8-OhBhB5EiwADyoY1VsWki-DUWa3hP2HET7U6ipsdCrW5SlMmWjIBLmedVTMY8Gi53j5rhoCRIYQAvD_BwE">Olivier Blanchard</a>, another leading scholar, because he had made similar observations himself. Larry and Olivier would go on to build a case for why secular stagnation was a defining theory of the economy and why government policies needed to respond to it. They helped reshape many people's understanding of the economy, and suggested that this period of slow growth and low interest rates was here to stay for a long time.<br/><br/>But today, Larry and Olivier are no longer the duo they used to be. As inflation has spiked worldwide, interest rates have followed suit. Earlier this year, Larry announced that he was no longer on the secular stagnation train. Olivier, meanwhile, believes we're just going through a minor blip and will return to a period of low interest rates within the near future. He doesn't see the deep forces that led to a long-run decline in interest rates as just vanishing. Who's right? The future of the global economy could depend on the answer.<em><br/><br/>Help support Planet Money  by subscribing to Planet Money+ </em><a href="http://n.pr/PM-digital"><em>in Apple Podcasts</em></a><em> or at </em><a href="https://n.pr/3HlREPz"><em>plus.npr.org/planetmoney</em></a><em>.</em><br/><br/>Learn more about sponsor message choices: <a href="https://podcastchoices.com/adchoices">podcastchoices.com/adchoices</a><br/><br/><a href="https://www.npr.org/about-npr/179878450/privacy-policy">NPR Privacy Policy</a>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>A Great Recession bank takeover</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Earlier this month, we saw the largest bank collapse since the 2008 financial crisis. For many of us, seeing Silicon Valley Bank's meltdown brought us right back to that time 15 years ago, at the beginning of what would become the Great Recession. <br/><br/>In early 2009, one or two banks were failing every week. That's when Planet Money reporter Chana Joffe-Walt went inside one of those banks: the Bank of Clark County, in Washington State. Her reporting on the inner workings of a bank collapse and government takeover helps explain exactly what happens when a bank goes under, minute-by-minute. <br/><br/>This story originally aired in March 2009 on This American Life, from WBEZ Chicago. We're airing it for the first time in full on our podcast.<br/><br/><em>This version of the story was produced by Dylan Sloan and edited by Dave Blanchard. It was fact-checked by Sierra Juarez and engineered by Katherine Silva.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[Earlier this month, we saw the largest bank collapse since the 2008 financial crisis. For many of us, seeing Silicon Valley Bank's meltdown brought us right back to that time 15 years ago, at the beginning of what would become the Great Recession. <br/><br/>In early 2009, one or two banks were failing every week. That's when Planet Money reporter Chana Joffe-Walt went inside one of those banks: the Bank of Clark County, in Washington State. Her reporting on the inner workings of a bank collapse and government takeover helps explain exactly what happens when a bank goes under, minute-by-minute. <br/><br/>This story originally aired in March 2009 on This American Life, from WBEZ Chicago. We're airing it for the first time in full on our podcast.<br/><br/><em>This version of the story was produced by Dylan Sloan and edited by Dave Blanchard. It was fact-checked by Sierra Juarez and engineered by Katherine Silva.

      <title>The battle over Osage headrights</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Richard J. Lonsinger is a member of the Ponca tribe of Oklahoma, who was adopted at a young age into a white family of three. He eventually reconnected with his birth family, but when his birth mother passed away in 2010, he wasn't included in the distribution of her estate. Feeling both hurt and excluded, he asked a judge to re-open her estate, to give him a part of one particular asset: an Osage headright.<br/><br/>An Osage headright is a share of profits from resources like oil, gas, and coal that have been extracted from the Osage Nation's land. These payments can be sizeable - thousands or even tens of thousands of dollars a year. Historically, they were even larger – in the 1920s the Osage were some of the wealthiest people in the world. But that wealth also made them a target and subject to paternalistic and predatory laws. Over the previous century, hundreds of millions of dollars in oil money have been taken from the Osage people.<br/><br/>On today's show: the story of how Richard Lonsinger gradually came to learn this history, and how he made his peace with his part of a complicated inheritance. <br/><br/><em>This episode was produced by Willa Rubin with help from Alyssa Jeong Perry and Emma Peaslee.

      <title>Inside a bank run</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Sometimes you hear these stories about an airplane that suddenly nosedives. Everyone onboard thinks this is it, and then the plane levels out and everything is fine. For about 72 hours, people and companies that had deposited millions of dollars at the Silicon Valley Bank — many of whom were in the tech industry — thought they had lost absolutely everything to a bank collapse.<br/><br/>Two weeks later, the situation at Silicon Valley Bank has leveled off. The FDIC seized the bank and eventually made all of its depositors whole. But to understand what that financial panic felt like, we retrace the Silicon Valley Bank run and eventual collapse. We hear from four people who were part of the bank run — when they realized early rumblings, what it felt like in the full stampede, what hard decisions they faced, and what the aftermath felt like. And along the way, we uncover the lessons you can only learn when you think the entire world is ending. <br/><br/><em>This episode was reported by Kenny Malone, produced by Alyssa Jeong Perry with help from Dave Blanchard, engineered by Brian Jarboe, fact-checked by Sierra Juarez, and edited by Jess Jiang. <br/><br/>Help support Planet Money and get bonus episodes by subscribing to Planet Money+ </em><a href="http://n.pr/PM-digital"><em>in Apple Podcasts</em></a><em> or at </em><a href="https://n.pr/3HlREPz"><em>plus.npr.org/planetmoney</em></a><em>.</em><br/><br/>Learn more about sponsor message choices: <a href="https://podcastchoices.com/adchoices">podcastchoices.com/adchoices</a><br/><br/><a href="https://www.npr.org/about-npr/179878450/privacy-policy">NPR Privacy Policy</a>]]></description>

      <title>How Silicon Valley Bank failed</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Silicon Valley Bank was the 16th largest bank in America, the bank of choice for tech startups and big-name venture capitalists. Then, in the span of just a few days, it collapsed. Whispers that SVB might be in trouble spread like wildfire through group texts and Twitter posts. Depositors raced to empty their accounts, withdrawing $42 billion in a single day. Last Friday, after regulators declared that SVB had failed, the FDIC seized the bank.<br/><br/>As the dust settles on the biggest bank failure — and bank rescue — in recent memory, we're still figuring out <em>what happened. </em>But poor investment choices, weak regulation, and customer panic all played their parts.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[Silicon Valley Bank was the 16th largest bank in America, the bank of choice for tech startups and big-name venture capitalists. Then, in the span of just a few days, it collapsed. Whispers that SVB might be in trouble spread like wildfire through group texts and Twitter posts. Depositors raced to empty their accounts, withdrawing $42 billion in a single day. Last Friday, after regulators declared that SVB had failed, the FDIC seized the bank.<br/><br/>As the dust settles on the biggest bank failure — and bank rescue — in recent memory, we're still figuring out <em>what happened. </em>But poor investment choices, weak regulation, and customer panic all played their parts. We'll look into the bank's collapse to understand what it can teach us about the business of banking itself.<br/><br/><em>This episode was produced by Willa Rubin, with help from Dave Blanchard.

      <title>The value of good teeth</title>
      <description><![CDATA[As a kid, Ryanne Jones' friend accidentally hit her in the mouth with a hammer, knocking out her two front teeth. Her parents never had enough money for the dental care needed to fix them, so Ryanne lived much of her adult life with a chipped and crooked smile. <br/><br/>Ryanne spent a while as a single mom working low-wage jobs, but she had higher aspirations: she interviewed dozens of times a year for higher-paying roles that she was more than qualified for.

      <title>Meow Money Meow Problems</title>

      <title>Jay &amp; Shai's debt ceiling adventure</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Every year, the U.S. government spends more money than it takes in. In order to fund all that spending, the country takes on debt. Congress has the power to limit how much debt the U.S. takes on. Right now, the debt limit is $31.4 trillion dollars. Once we reach that limit, Congress has a few options so that the government keeps paying its bills: Raise the debt limit, suspend it, or eliminate it entirely. <br>That debate and negotiations are back this season. One thing that is in short supply, but very important for these negotiations, is good information. Shai Akabas, of the Bipartisan Policy Center, knows this well. Right now, he and his team are working on figuring out when exactly the U.S. government could run out of money to pay its obligations — what they've dubbed: the "X Date." <br>Shai is determined to help prevent the U.S. government from blowing past the X Date without a solution. But this year's debt-ceiling negotiations are not going very well. Which is daunting, because if lawmakers don't figure something out, the ramifications for the global economy could be huge. <br>So, how did Shai become the go-to expert at the go-to think tank for debt ceiling information? It started in 2011, back when he and current Chair of the Federal Reserve Jay Powell, armed with a powerpoint and the pressure of a deadline, helped stave off economic disaster. <br><em>Help support Planet Money and get bonus episodes by subscribing to Planet Money+ in Apple Podcasts or at plus.npr.org/planetmoney.</em><br/><br/>Learn more about sponsor message choices: <a href="https://podcastchoices.com/adchoices">podcastchoices.com/adchoices</a><br/><br/><a href="https://www.npr.org/about-npr/179878450/privacy-policy">NPR Privacy Policy</a>]]></description>

      <title>Two Indicators: Inside the Fed, then and now</title>
      <description><![CDATA[A lot of the time, economic policy can seem pretty impersonal — cold, hard, data-driven. But at the heart of the Federal Reserve are people: fallible, complicated people who are just doing their best to steer the economy in the right direction. <br/><br/>Often, we remember them just for their economic decisions. But today, we're airing two episodes from our daily economics show <em>The Indicator </em>that profile the people inside the Fed. First, we're heading back to the 1970s to revisit Arthur Burns' oft-criticized stint as Fed chair. Next, we have a conversation with Mary Daly, the current president of the San Francisco Fed, about her remarkable path from high school dropout to one of the most important economic voices in the nation.<br/><br/><em>These two Indicator episodes were originally produced by Viet Le and Brittany Cronin.

      <title>The ice cream conspiracy</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Take a look in any supermarket ice cream freezer section and you may see a mystery. There are big containers of the typical ice cream brands: Breyers, Turkey Hill, and Edy's. And there are specialty brands that make gelato, low-fat and vegan ice creams. And then there are the fancy pints: which is mostly Ben & Jerry's and Häagen-Dazs.<br/><br/>Häagen-Dazs has flavors like vanilla, chocolate, pistachio—the sort of flavors that run smooth. And then Ben & Jerry's specializes in chunky flavors: Cherry Garcia, The Tonight Dough, Chunky Monkey, etc. The two hardly ever cross into the other's turf. Why?<br/><br/>It's possible they are experiencing something common to natural competition—they are specializing in what works best for them. But, as Christopher Sullivan of the University of Wisconsin-Madison suspects, the two companies may be engaging in what is known as "tacit collusion," where two parties silently agree to... stick to their own territory.<br/><br/>We try to get to the creamy core of what makes up a conspiracy, and how the consumer eventually loses out in this cold, cold war.<br/><br/><em>Today's episode was produced by Willa Rubin and Alyssa Jeong Perry.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[Take a look in any supermarket ice cream freezer section and you may see a mystery. There are big containers of the typical ice cream brands: Breyers, Turkey Hill, and Edy's. And there are specialty brands that make gelato, low-fat and vegan ice creams. And then there are the fancy pints: which is mostly Ben & Jerry's and Häagen-Dazs.<br/><br/>Häagen-Dazs has flavors like vanilla, chocolate, pistachio—the sort of flavors that run smooth. And then Ben & Jerry's specializes in chunky flavors: Cherry Garcia, The Tonight Dough, Chunky Monkey, etc. The two hardly ever cross into the other's turf. Why?<br/><br/>It's possible they are experiencing something common to natural competition—they are specializing in what works best for them. But, as Christopher Sullivan of the University of Wisconsin-Madison suspects, the two companies may be engaging in what is known as "tacit collusion," where two parties silently agree to... stick to their own territory.<br/><br/>We try to get to the creamy core of what makes up a conspiracy, and how the consumer eventually loses out in this cold, cold war.<br/><br/><em>Today's episode was produced by Willa Rubin and Alyssa Jeong Perry.

      <title>Baby's first market failure</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Anyone who has tried shopping for day care knows that it is tough out there.<br/><br/>For one, it is hard even to get your hands on information about costs, either online or over the phone – day cares will often only share their prices after you have taken a tour of their facilities. Even once you find a place you like, many day cares have waitlists stretching 6 months, 9 months, a year.<br/><br/>Waitlists are a classic economic sign that something isn't right, that prices are too low. But ask any parent and they will tell you that prices for day cares are actually too <em>high</em>. According to a recent report from the U.S. Treasury, more than 60% of families can't afford the full cost of high quality day care. Meanwhile, day care owners can barely afford to stay open. No one is happy.<br/><br/>On today's show, we get into the very weird, very broken market for day care. We will try to understand how this market can simultaneously strain parents' budgets and underpay its workers. And we will look at a few possible solutions.<br/><br/><em>This show was produced by Sam Yellowhorse Kesler. Emma Peaslee helped book the show. It was mastered by Gilly Moon.

      <description><![CDATA[It's Groundhog Day, and once again, the eyes of the nation have turned to a small town in Western Pennsylvania. Every February 2nd, the only story anyone can talk about is whether or not Punxsutawney Phil will see his own shadow. If he does: six more weeks of winter. If he doesn't: spring is on its way.<br/><br/>This year, in a cruel twist of fate reminiscent of the 1993 movie <em>Groundhog Day</em>, two Planet Money hosts have found themselves facing a curse. They'll be trapped in this never-ending groundhog news cycle until they can find a new February 2nd story to tell...something that has nothing to do with one furry prognosticator... something that changed the economy forever.<br/><br/>So rise and shine campers, and don't forget your booties as we journey through a series of Groundhog Days past to try to find a historical scoop.<br/><br/><em>This show was produced by Dave Blanchard and edited by Sally Helm.

      <description><![CDATA[Monopoly is one of the best-selling board games in history. <br/><br/>The game's staying power may in part be because of strong American lore — the idea that anyone, with just a little bit of cash, can rise from rags to riches.

      <title>In defense of gift giving</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Cold economic reasoning says, supposedly, that <a href="https://www.amherst.edu/media/view/104699/original/christmas.pdf">gifts are inefficient transfers of wealth</a>. But Planet Money host Jeff Guo believes in the economic virtues of gift giving. On today's show, Jeff tries to win over Planet Money's resident Scrooge, Kenny Malone, by going on a quest to find him the perfect gift. Along the way, they're visited by the spirits of three Nobel prize-winning economic theories that can explain why gift-giving is actually good. And by the end, Kenny's heart <em>may just</em> grow three sizes larger.

      <title>Carried interest wormhole</title>
      <description><![CDATA[The carried interest tax loophole is a way that wealthy Americans – often the people who manage hedge funds or private equity firms – avoid paying billions of dollars worth of taxes. It has been one of the most controversial yet durable features of the U.S. tax code. But where did it come from? Today we romp through space and time to piece together the origins of this loophole. There will be pirates and mutiny. A 50s tax-dodge-a-palooza. And perhaps the Michelangelo of tax lawyers. | Subscribe to Planet Money+ in <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/podcast/290783428">Apple Podcasts</a> or at <a href="http://plus.npr.org/planetmoney">plus.npr.org/planetmoney</a>.<br/><br/>Learn more about sponsor message choices: <a href="https://podcastchoices.com/adchoices">podcastchoices.com/adchoices</a><br/><br/><a href="https://www.npr.org/about-npr/179878450/privacy-policy">NPR Privacy Policy</a>]]></description>

      <title>SUMMER SCHOOL 5: Car Parts, Celery &amp; The Labor Market</title>
      <description><![CDATA[You can learn a lot about a person from their job. The same can be said of an economy. The market for jobs can us a lot about how the economy is doing, but more importantly, it is where we look to see who the economy is working for, and who is left behind. In today's lesson we'll visit two workplaces each facing a different labor puzzle. At one end, there's the question of when to replace a worker with a robot, and what it is like to be that worker waiting for the robots to come. We'll also visit a farm where raising wages aren't enough to attract the workers needed to do the work.

      <title>SUMMER SCHOOL 4: Inflation &amp; Drinking Buddies</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Inflation can be one of the scariest forces in the economy. As prices rise and your dollar doesn't go as far, you feel poorer, and it's all out of your control. To better understand inflation, we turn to the story of Brazil, where, in the 90s, hyperinflation threatened to derail the whole economy until the country turned to a group of unlikely heroes: four drinking buddies. | Subscribe to Planet Money+ in Apple Podcasts or at plus.npr.org/planetmoney. |At <em>this </em>Summer School, phones ARE allowed during class...

      <description><![CDATA[It's macro time! Today: Keynes vs. Hayek. <br/><br/>Season 3 of summer school is here asking the biggest economic questions about what makes an entire economy grow or contract? Things like, is there a "right" level of unemployment? Who gains from trade? What rhymes with 'paradox of thrift'? Also, inflation, we'll get to inflation. <br/><br/>Episode 1 begins with the rise of macroeconomics as a field, with one of the great economic debates of the 20th century: what causes booms and busts, and what can the government do about it? How free should a free market be? <br/><br/>It's a debate (over beats and with an actual rap battle) between John Maynard Keynes and F.A Hayek.<br/><br/><a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@planetmoney/video/7119990664825261358?is_from_webapp=1&sender_device=pc&web_id=7119593897223456302">Watch this Tik Tok</a> to learn more. | Subscribe to our weekly newsletter <a href="https://www.npr.org/newsletter/money?utm_source=rss_feed_copy&utm_medium=podcast&utm_term=planet_money">here</a>. | Listen to past seasons of Summer School <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/2naS9Y5nWSli9vi9bOvGxp">here</a>. | Listen to our econ songs of the summer on Spotify. |<br/><br/>Learn more about sponsor message choices: <a href="https://podcastchoices.com/adchoices">podcastchoices.com/adchoices</a><br/><br/><a href="https://www.npr.org/about-npr/179878450/privacy-policy">NPR Privacy Policy</a>]]></description>

Also, inflation, we'll get to inflation. <br/><br/>Episode 1 begins with the rise of macroeconomics as a field, with one of the great economic debates of the 20th century: what causes booms and busts, and what can the government do about it? How free should a free market be? <br/><br/>It's a debate (over beats and with an actual rap battle) between John Maynard Keynes and F.A Hayek.<br/><br/><a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@planetmoney/video/7119990664825261358?is_from_webapp=1&sender_device=pc&web_id=7119593897223456302">Watch this Tik Tok</a> to learn more. | Subscribe to our weekly newsletter <a href="https://www.npr.org/newsletter/money?utm_source=rss_feed_copy&utm_medium=podcast&utm_term=planet_money">here</a>. | Listen to past seasons of Summer School <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/2naS9Y5nWSli9vi9bOvGxp">here</a>. | Listen to our econ songs of the summer on Spotify. |<br/><br/>Learn more about sponsor message choices: <a href="https://podcastchoices.com/adchoices">podcastchoices.com/adchoices</a><br/><br/><a href="https://www.npr.org/about-npr/179878450/privacy-policy">NPR Privacy Policy</a>]]></content:encoded>
